Sentiment Classification using N-gram IDF and Automated Machine Learning (2019)

### Abstract
We propose a sentiment classification method with a general machine learning framework.
For feature representation, n-gram IDF, an extension of Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), is used to extract software-engineering-related, dataset-specific, positive, neutral, and negative n-gram expressions.
For classifiers, an automated machine learning tool, which optimizes hyperparameters and constructs an ensemble of multiple classifiers, is used.
