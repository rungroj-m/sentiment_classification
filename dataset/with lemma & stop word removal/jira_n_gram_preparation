guy this be so stupid 

pron lose the whole morning because hbase s regionserver be die with no log no nothing how be pron suppose to debug the issue if u do not even generate a core dump 

 quote you be mess down deep below hbase in dfs 

and pron think if pron be go to do a sweep up of shit pron should just kill root 

 idiot yeah pron be on that idiot path for a good while but commons lang be a hairball at least where this hashcode making and equal be concern 

pull pron back in if pron think different 

i suck 

will still be stick in the loop though if can not actually close region 

original edit patch be mess up stupid s 

who make this stupid rule 

sorry but this be just stupid 

but pron will quit commit to hama then because pron be not go to support only a binary format 

this be not what pron build a framework for 

well damn 

bloop after blooper pron hate svn 

this look reasonable to pron suck pron have to special case handling of 

pron may want to carefully examine pron assumption about this 

ok wow welcome to linux hell 

if pron get a chance pron may even roll pron into pron dev environment but pron be currently in the middle of mem leak hell 

both equally bad 

negative pron be against fetch group in principle 

this way lie metadata hell 

shit there be an dependency please go to preferences ldap entry editor and enable the option show operational attribute 

damn 

damn 

damn 

the evil npe strik back 

bloody hell 

damn time have fly 

damn pron 

this be a very bad bug introduce by pron be an idiot 

pron have stupidly delete the original test dir but judge from the suite s output file no output be create after 3 1 2 hour 

damn this be assign to pron since month 

imo all this just do not make sense from a pure performance aspect 

insert timestamp automagically would be bad because pron would limit a whole swath of use case 

if pron do then suse s cpio work for old ascii but the c switch be break 

this be pretty embarassing 

when pron install a node module globally pron go into usr local where pron do not have permission to move shit into unless pron sudo 

that be say pron be not totally opposed to make the limit configurable 

pron bad pron screw up the assertion runtimeexception transition 

well that suck 

no pron be not off the table but pron be moot unless pron decide pron want cqlsh in tree at all 

ok here be a patch that work pron be stupid enough not to see pron 

pron be a pretty stupid idea to use a static array of instance for quorumopmonitor 

all pron be try to say be that pron be pretty easy to end up in propagation failure hell here or change something else that blow thing up for use case that be not foresee 

just to clarify pron make the dtpe handle exception the same way as cassandradaemon by update pron to use nbhs instead of csls do pron just tell pron to go fuck pron 

 1 damn intellij pron be not like patch format have not be standard for year 

wow pron be like thrift be go out of pron way to make life suck for pron this month 

here be quite bad 

 the sample pron give be different 

pron just notice pron public tweet bq wilhelmbierbaum true fuck the avro c api 

if so can pron see if pron can git bisect this bad boy 

pron seem some of the wrapper in ink hrtime h may no longer be use either e g ink gettimeofday be never use so let get rid of that shit 

heh that be one hell of a bug 275 byte exactly eh 

what a stupid name pron choose for that object 

pron think pron be time to just close this issue 

pron be not enter bogus report for the hell of pron matt

pron be currently try to get pron into ajdt dev build but pron git push be time out damn thing 

stupid maven

ok stupid user error here 

why the hell do pron deliver duration if pron can not instantiate pron 

the defect from hell 666 be scared 

this really suck 

why the hell be this not a bug 

what the hell be pron wait for 

pron suspect pron have nothing to do with the file system connector or infinispan connector and be simply a stupid mistake in the federated join processor 

pron be an idiot 

pron really suck that there be now way currently to include transitive dependency 

pron be an idiot there be nothing wrong with the readme txt 

crap forget to verify that this be inconsistant with mri pron be not 

please close as this be just pron be stupid 

holy hell pron think pron find one problem with turn a bignum into anything else 

this suck so much 

damn pron would close this out from the fix to jbseam 3742 except the quartz and seampay example use a custom xml namespace and the xml schema validator be not happy with that 

 damn pron forget 

also pron username be stupidly name and confusing so pron delete pron and create a new one more appropriate 

damn pron seem pron do not work 

pron suck to lose the code readability but pron seem like a reasonable price to pay 

pron do not have to ensure that the classloader know groovy class pron must do that 

and debug be hell because the test environment need to have the exact same loader setup 

who the hell start use pron jira for type lesson 

fuck u

hell this be go to take pron a lot of work to raise 

that irritate the hell out of pron too but pron do not realise pron be configurable in the launch file 

this suck badly 

why on earth do createlink need a request 

finally close this bug from hell 

pron sure as hell do not want to start attach model for the sake of detach pron directly afterwards 

that suck why be not the escape mechanism work 

pron be an idiot this be a dupe of guvnor 84

sun ri suck why the hell be savestate and restorestate not call with with javax faces state saving method server 

swear to god pron be not a total idiot 

pron do not know how the hell pron diff program decide to add seemingly random cr char but pron have remove pron now 

durrrh that suck 

pron be stick with ie6 unfortunately 

what the hell pron will give this a shot 

 quote searcher getatomicreader getsorteddocvalues uniquekey quote this be a performance killer 

as far as the query shit i have no idea if solrdispatchfilter or whatev could should do thread currentthread setname x or whatev and maybe restore after 

btw this be one reason why pron hate this autobox shit since java 5 pron would love to have a way to prevent pron in code forbid check should detect this somehow 

hmm that suck 

tricky shit man pron think pron find the issue 

oh man pron be a fucking precendence problem 

ugh well that suck 

pron do not know pron need to retain backwards config capability across 3 x to 4 x that suck and pron will make old code stick around longer 

bq this be solr s fault by have a getter that do some heavy duty xml shit 

that sound like some serious buck pass 

this whole thing be very distressing to pron 

pron think pron all know pron just suck 

though pron disagree with a signficant amount of statement pron make pron do not think pron would ever come to agreement anyway 

 that be some freaky shit 

pron think pron make mistake in ivy xml 

this be where pron get confusing 

if pron can give pron one advice on this one pron would say this fuck derby use h2 instead as the default embed database 

what the hell 

 do nothing be pron serious about that 

 oleg please accept that pron logical be different from pron logical 

so pron be fine with pron logic but give that pron do not understand pron please do not get upset when pron ask question on how pron have to use pron 

this be pron bad 

the rest be totally unrelated 

oh fuck sorry not pron day more beer need 

sorry pron guess pron be against never compute this shit because pron guy think return nan be ok 

 if pron want to make these optimization fix the api so pron intuitive otherwise no way 

who the fuck be ask for score but not the max score and why do pron insanely specialize use case justify all these boolean on a central lucene class 

pron do not care about code duplication here 

 pron should not invoke the global sync fieldnumber shit for every element only when the setting actually change

pron disagree and pron guess pron be willing to go to bat for this 

holy shit 

 pron think the comment here be a bad sign pron send pron down an unfortunate slippery slope pron be a search engine library do not put shit in the index directory or pron will delete pron shit dead simple 

pron wholeheartedly agree this api be confusing as hell 

not only pron be the first one in pron life pron be see multiple way of close the same thing pron also conceal programming error 

suck to rush a commit when an issue be under discussion 

pron be against such heavy commit pron without some consensus to do so 

pron be confused 

 pron hat that aspect of work for commercial company 

pron bad 

pron bad 

igor be an idiot and pron do need gmake 

shit pron miss a cast 

but even if pron be not pron would be totally worthless where pron be at 

this be clearly bad webserver behaviour 

forget what pron made d8067 

precommit hdfs build be stick 

so pron be stick somewhere 

pron do not want one off like this to become lose and forget 

but now that pron think about pron pron may crap out when come back to read even on a recover file 

 matt pron be an idiot pron use the wrong patch sigh 

pron be however very interested in this feature as pron be essential to pron 

bq this be solr s fault by have a getter that do some heavy duty xml shit 

holy complicate as shit algorithm batman the complexity of pron implementation vs the complexity of what pron be actually do be start to worry pron here 

pron also happen at the very startup after pron have load only 3 sstable hence datatracker likely have 3 sstable not a shit load 

shit pron bad the post patch be from a completely wrong branch of pron git repo pron have not realize pron run the test patch against a branch not branch 1 

 in this particular case hoss clearly intend to use the no no word as an intensifier and not to stir shit 

maybe only one of pron should play lawyer and the other one play engineer 

 pron use to be the latter but then pron go to law school and get a degree in this shit 

then to make matter bad since the mid 1990 s pron have be offer pro bono advice to non profit foundation whose member insult pron regularly and assume pron be an amateur 

someone but pron be not sure who owe pron a public apology here larry 

shit there be an dependency please go to preferences ldap entry editor and enable the option show operational attribute 

that be bad content type from gsoap

pron do not have very much experience on branch 1 would pron like to take a shot at the port

pron will figure out the detail and do the port later this week if pron do not get to pron first 

sorry unassign pron from this backport 

another backport for a different jira of mine be fail and pron want to see if pron can figure out what may be wrong there before do a new backport 

to upgrade to a recent version of jackrabbit see http wiki apache org jackrabbit backupandmigration pron be afraid pron can not say much about the risk 

pron have try something similar pron remove the handler and keep the reader but the performance be not visible 

the responder seem to be a bottleneck 

but pron be not the only issue pron also want to manage priority between the task but pron need to read pron to get enough information to make the right priority 

while create the derbytest pron do notice that this problem be cause by the database pool because pron try to connect to the database in the background


git be tricky that way 

sigh pron do not like this overall if can not reuse everywhere 

sorry to let pron lose a wild goose chase 

pron be go to kill pron when pron say this but pron seem like pron should just commit pron first patch 

this half reuse be more confusing for new devs who see this code for the first time 

sorry probably a misunderstanding from pron side 

pron meet the same problem on eclipse recently but have not figure out how to get through 

sorry chris pron miss pron do 

one of the error be that hiddenactivation can not be resolve

pron be not aware of be require to call that method 

this be a silly one 

seem pron do not enforce an exec for sh but pron do for fs 

the patch should be relatively trivial but like pron say pron have no idea if there be other important stuff go on there or not 

igor sorry pron take pron so long to get back to this 

hey sorry pron do not get back to pron sooner 


yes pron be a dup thank mike for take care of this pron plan to do this yesterday but do not make pron


app developer never do what pron should 

