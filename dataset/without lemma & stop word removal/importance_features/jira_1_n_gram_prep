 FOUserAgent getStream is cool and very easy to use now that it s properly documented 

i kinda like the black acctually but that may largely be due to my prefering the fire solr logo over the futuristic magnifying glass the red orange contrasts nicely with the black grey to my mind the Solr Sun connection has allways been really cool 



Ok cool this is just a matter of adding strings to the various NotFound https github com apache mesos blob 0 15 0 rc4 src files files cpp L160 returns in files cpp There are a number of error cases in the browse https github com apache mesos blob 0 15 0 rc4 src files files cpp L204 and read https github com apache mesos blob 0 15 0 rc4 src files files cpp L204 endpoints I d imagine one could change the javascript to generate bad requests which should be sufficient to test this 

cool no worries 

Cool feature Performance It looks like scripts are read from the resource loader and parsed again eval for every update request 

Thanks Ram That seems like a definite improvement 

Interesting that you decided not to detect the error based on finding two similarly named operations 

It s OK 

