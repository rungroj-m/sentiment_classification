really like this app allows me to both catalog my collection and display and sort my collection to make it easier for friends to decide what they want to watch i recommend you get the pro version it s diverse features and ability to access your database from any of your appliances or computers is a blessing the ability to modify the meta data stored for your movies would be good as sometimes the data is miss classified or incorrectly genred

holy crap i lack the words to describe just how amazing this is on 4 1 seriously i ve tried to explain it to people who haven t used it and i just can t i fail as an orator pretty pointless on older android versions though although i have to wonder what the typical 1 star trolls are going on about battery use the amount of my battery this uses is almost nonexistent and complaining that an optional opt in feature is running in the background when its entire purpose is to run in the background is just stupid

a superb app i came to android about a year ago from an iphone and i tried every reddit client out there such as baconreader and reddit news these were all good apps but none of them compared to my experience with alienblue then i tried reddit sync and it has become almost exclusively the only way i read redditch anymore the holo interface and black night mode are easy on my eyes and it has all of the features i need

simply the best i very rarely write reviews even more rare is when i like an app enough to buy it this app deserves both i have seriously tried most music players for the android and this one has everything i need audio engine is tops start and stop via headphone jack great album art download lots of other programs have these things but either lack in these or other features i especially like the simple issue of bass and treble control price a little high that was the only thing holding me back from buying it sooner was thinking of giving it 4 stars because of price but what the heck i gave it five 

i like t this game is cool


excellent app but add more this is much better than samsung s equation detection but the only thing missing in this app is the lack of variety just like in the note 10 1 please add more equations and have the ability to solve complex algebra i ll be glad to pay for such a feature makes work so much easier 

just great excellent i wish it had the black list feature

great apps works well and looks great lots of available providers from the 5 or so apps i ve tested deliveries seems to support the most i submitted a bug report when statuses from one of the providers wasn t working as expected the developer promptly got back to me and fixed the issue only feature i would like is auto detection of provider based on the tracking number but as a fellow programmer i understand the challenges presented by such a feature so this doesn t affect my rating 

excellent app no complaints at all but still waiting for urdu localization

excellent app for galaxy s4 the major lack to me on my gs4 is that the home screen will not rotate to landscape mode this app resolves the problem i have a feature request the app has to be manually started each time the phone restarts then the setting has to be selected then the close button selected an autostart option with a selectable default mode would make this the ideal app 

an excellent offline rss reader on my nexus 7 a solid simple lightweight reader the only feature i miss compared with my desktop reader is the ability to group feeds in folders thanks are due to the author this is an open source program and there are similar apps based on it if you have one of these installed as i had uninstall it first or you get a duplicate error this is not a web based reader like google reader but you can import your feeds as an opml file 

good application best news application it should add a feature of notification also 

excellent really great app much better than other bus apps the data is sometimes poor but this is not the app s fault looses 1 star as it occasionally force closes on launch but isn t really a problem as it auto reloads feature requests buses moving along the google maps in real time colour in times that i can easily walk to from current gps in green ones i have to run to in orange and ones i ll miss in red 

one thing missing i really like this app simple user interface and works smoothly espn should add a feature to notify you when your current selection is finished that is the only thing missing 

good good app could do with more size customisations for the widget 

awesome great game but in the next update y all should add a bet with cash feature

only 4 stars i love this app i am able to save all of my pdf and epub documents i only have it 4 stars because when in night mode is it very sensitive and if touched wrong the entire screen will turn the lettering black and i have to re install the app please work on brightness feature 

excellent calculator this is an excellent floating calculator in spite of some minor shortcomings it has all the features that one would want in a small calculator that can be used while one is using other apps the lack of memory functions is easily overcome with the use of parentheses and with these the copy function is more than adequate for most purposes one useful feature which it does not have at the moment is the ability to paste insert data copied from say a text file this would make it possible to use earier results stored in a text file nevertheless this is an excellent app and the developer should be congratulated for a job well done and for generously making it available a no cost 

improving rapidly this app used to be crappy while the service was ok but recently the app has started receiving updates on a regular basis adding a lot of basic functionality that should have been there from the beginning now it features landscape support resume from last position notification bar controls and save to sd card however i still sorely miss a decent widget easily sortable queues or the extensions found in the desktop app 

very good but can you add download all attachment as zip option we miss this very nice feature which is available in web version 

great customization but old and outdated the keyboard has excellent customization but it lack a feature to learn new words automatically and the ui are old

great app i love this app it s great to have my book lists with me wherever i go and i can easily keep track of which books i ve read to each of my kids one thing missing is the browse feature like the apple version has i miss that add that and i will rate 5 stars 

very easy and fun not many programs deserve a 5 star but this is one of them i do miss some features or maybe i just don t know how to use the app like continue reading from my last page ad it sometimes reloads from start with me articles but overall this is a very good app thanks guys 

great launcher what a nice launcher should add locker feature

need to add a feature you guys should add a custom car builder feature where you can just build your own car but every part you buy will just keep adding up your total overall great app its fun and it kills time

excellent everything is awesome but so far i have found that whenever i turn on wifi my battery drains after using this software may it happens due to widgets or panel but if i turn off it doesn t happen 

amazing awesome app for mathematics worth thousand starts thanks devs though the ui is hard to understand thanks for the small size

i love it but i would love to make this my default sms app i m an old textra and chomp user only gripe is need a lot of improvement like bubble chats even u don t make it bubble it s ok just have a bit of space bet messages cause it is confusing and cluttered to look at then also led notification that s one thing that keeps me from using this as a daily driver we need better notifications this app is worth 5 stars i d even buy it if it had a price just to have it full featured and also text counts on icon

very fun worth the memory d

great game its an amazing game but 4 1 ie impossible i know how to do it but there is such a small chance of doing it and for 3 7 you flick the battery to the plain box and the on the left side do the colours it said on the right and you do it for the otherside everytime you get it right you should hear a ding of some sort keep doing that untill the play button comes up toget 3 stars

good app it s customizable which i like sometimes it s a bit difficult getting items to line up properly and the areas for each part of the display don t change size dynamically so the font sizes will get bigger or smaller to fit in the space alloted for them which i don t like overall it s a good app though 

amazing well designed but confusing says i have a lot more free space than android reports 

if only i m using this app on a note 10 1 and have also tried the obvious competition there are some features i really like and already miss in other apps especially the very well implemented blending and the in depth controls for setting pressure sensitivity the deal breaker for me at the moment noticeably worse brush lag than in other apps note there is actually a note mode which limits the area to the current tile and is much smoother but offers only a small selection of tools while active i d love to have that kind of performance with the full functionality within reason when it comes to more demanding bigger brushes short version love nearly everything about it and will definitely buy the full version when the performance gets improved
