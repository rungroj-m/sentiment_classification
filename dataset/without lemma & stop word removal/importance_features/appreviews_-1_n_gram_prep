not so grand the features are great if they work which unfortunately is nearly never constantly loses connection to the server when i m on stable wifi crashes continuously doesn t keep up the stream to chat and doesn t like to load lootables at all this app hasn t been updated in over a year and it s easy to see the lack of support 

 so far so good however freezes up way too much hope that error gets fixed soon or i will have to give it the boot 

alright its okay but it freezes all the time

galaxy s2 love this app very useful only thing that bugs me is from time to time my screen blacks out and force closes the app when i back out 





great but game is not responding payed 99 so i cld continue playing not working will rate 5 when i can continue i have sufficient storage space and to b safe i uninstalled two games with large storage needs i have shut my phone down and restarted it the game will still not work 

 does not let me patch mods or mod scripts

 this app is terrible i am in a good relationship and we are happy together

 good features slow deliveries and hit and miss notifications 

average no doubt the art work of the game is original and fits the environment well but that alone does not make a good title the gameplay is interesting but lacks a real reason to come back or be played over another game the split screen in the only feature that stood out but even then it got boring quickly i liked the game thought it was promising but a lack of ideas to keep me playing made the experience fall short 

about ebook one star for ebook

ever best but since update many feature gone and many lack when use 

hate the app love the moga and love the service but this app is hideous

slot game it was a great game but it has stopped paying out almost completely 

for an older version maybe the pack is bad now i know 

bleh channels won t play and poor genre selection no holiday or otr 

blech horrible lack of features and customization good for only occasional typing i guess 

airplane mode i know you can t do anything about it but the lack of airplane mode scheduling in kitkat just sucks other features are very useful 

flash i don t have flash and i don t know how to get it

please just bring back the old maps how do you update a software and take away all the good features while not adding any new ones i miss so many things the button that shows my entire route in nav the option for other routes the option to search while in nav for things in my route the option to just view the map while nav is still running separately i use the gps a lot for work and this update is killing me i need old version of maps please

should add more filters filters are a little lame and don t suit my pictures if you add more filters i ll rate it 5 stars lt 3 and you should add more fonts and unique features unlike other editing apps 

far from as cool as smartglass i went with a ps4 rather than the xbox one but i do miss smart glass they need to make this app enable the voice features and things like the store should be built in not a browser link 

good but lacking all in all the app works but its pretty lack luster it does a few things well and a few ok like the feed friends list and adding messaging and connecting to your ps4 for second display features but it stops there the store takes you a external browser the second screen features are limited and the keyboard is a bit buggy and only works 70 of the time its slow and the positioning of things is not efficient the ui isn t all that intuitive with its lack of gestures and easily accessible features 

lack some features please provide option for marking notifications as read or unread also option for commenting on post using picture

lack of important functions 1 you can not select multiple images to send at once in this same application 2 you can not send photos to friends they didn t move to telegram yet 3 no option for copying a fragment of a message 4 no automatic sending of any media if the connection is established again you have to do it manually not to mention that these features are available in whatsapp implement these and you will be a serious challenger and gain 5 stars 

okay but lack some features some features i would love to see is the ability to log in and being able to see the ratings and comments on memes kinda like the ios version

features and new color theme awful i really hate the new android color or lack thereof the blue was fine and i m pretty upset you guys got rid of it bring back the blue and the punctuation on long pressing the period and why is the keyboard shrinking when i switch to symbols 

too slow app is slower than mobile site and or competing livejournal apps like eljay search the marketplace for it what with the lack of features even in the main pc site it s proof that livejournal is no match for even the much maligned facebook rip livejournal 

cant read japanese if ur not japanese u can read it put it in english so we can understand it 

x works but wish it could send pictures and text its too simple they should add features to be like voxer 

beautiful widget only problem i think is inspite of turning gps off the app is continuously using it as shown by my battery usage statistics 

poor bakvas interface and very very slow app 

this app is a waste of time i can log in but it always freezes and eventually crashes i do not feel confident with the security on this app if wf can leave us hanging with a horrible app for such a big bank uninstalled htc one

bugs in latest update great app until last update that drain battery and continue to use huge amount of data at the background 

app is slow it it not well organized the categories like shooters there is only one witch is incorrect and its slow it freezes scrolling is glitchy etc 

battery emptied my battery for 50 in 1 hour while phone was in standby don t know how but had to remove in immediately sorry 

addictive freezes sometimes annoying having to wait for the lives to recharge

 horrible on moment my battery dies faster 

 eats battery life like the cookie monster eats cookies has the most features of any other system app slows the system to a crawl unistalled 

good and bad it has virus 

great app major glitch the update was nice but it prevents my phone from going to sleep even when the app isn t open uninstalling the app fixed it but i miss it this app alone cut my battery life by more than 20 

battery issues the app will usually consume 20 25 of my battery constantly having to force stop 

 cute but eats up alot of battery 

needs work there should be a way to adjust the shape and location of the eyes cheeks and lips everyone s features are not shaped the same even with a well lit picture taken at the right angle your app proves inaccurate which is highly disappointing seeing as you are a big name cosmetic brand and not some rinky dink developer making a cheap advertising heavy app for little girls i expected more from mary kay and this type of one size fits all lack of attention to detail and diversity makes you look bad 

ads great app but the ads come up all the time and it ruins it

regret buying this app fcs so randomly that it s almost impossible to use it for longer period of time lack of updates have made it even more impossible to use haven t seen even a single much requested feature by the community being implemented in this app despite being ok play store for more or less 4 months now disappointed 

 fails to download phone has sufficient memory and specs 

slow no point the viewfinder display is really laggy and slow doesn t seem to offer any creative black and white features so how does it improve over just desaturating color photos 

 convenient but very unfriendly to the battery

pages don t fill the screen well with the latest update i m now able to sign into the app on my galaxy s4 and it s considerably more stable and responsive on my nook hd but unfortunately now when i try to read comics the pages only take up about 2 3 of the screen s available real estate with black borders on the left right and bottom even if i pinch zoom to fill the screen when i move to the next page it goes back to the original size hopefully they can address that issue and then start adding some of the other standard features of comic readers update 8 26 13 today s update still doesn t resolve the issue with comics rendering in about 2 3 of the screen while i m happy to see that they ve doubled the number of issues you can have offline the first time i tried to open one the app crashed back to the launcher all in all this app is still completely unusable on android imo
