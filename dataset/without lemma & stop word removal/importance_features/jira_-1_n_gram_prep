guys this is so stupid 

I lost the whole morning cause HBase s RegionServer was dying with no logs no nothing how Am I supposed to debug the issue if u do not even generate a core dump 

 quote You are messing down deep below hbase in dfs 

And I think if we re going to do a sweep up of shit we should just kill root 

 idiot Yeah I was on that idiot path for a good while but commons lang is a hairball at least where this hashcode making and equals is concerned 

Pull it back in if you think different 

i suck 

Will still be stuck in the loop though if can t actually close regions 

Original edited patch was messed up stupid sed 

Who made this stupid rule 

Sorry but this is just stupid 

But I will quit committing to Hama then because I m not going to support ONLY a binary format 

This is not what I build a framework for 

Well damn 

Blooper after blooper I hate SVN 

This looks reasonable to me sucks we have to special case handling of 

You may want to carefully examine your assumption about this 

Ok wow welcome to Linux hell 

If I get a chance I may even roll it into our dev environment but I am currently in the middle of mem leak hell 

Both equally bad 

Negative I am against fetch groups in principle 

This way lies metadata hell 

Shit there is an dependency Please go to Preferences LDAP Entry Editor and enable the option Show operational attributes 

Damn 

Damn 

Damn 

The evil NPE strik back 

Bloody hell 

Damn time has flown 

Damn it 

This was a very bad bug introduced by me being an idiot 

I have stupidly deleted the original test dir but judging from the suite s output files no output was created after 3 1 2 hours 

damn this was assigned to you since months 

Imo all this just doesn t make sense from a pure performance aspect 

Inserting timestamps automagically would be bad because it would limit a whole swath of use cases 

If they do then Suse s cpio works for old ascii but the c switch is broken 

This is pretty embarassing 

When you install a node module globally it goes into usr local where you don t have permissions to move shit into unless you sudo 

That being said I m not totally opposed to making the limit configurable 

My bad I screwed up the assertion RuntimeException transition 

Well that sucks 

No it s not off the table but it s moot unless we decide we want cqlsh in tree at all 

Ok here is a patch that works I was stupid enough not to see it 

It was a pretty stupid idea to use a static array of instances for QuorumOpMonitor 

All I m trying to say is that it s pretty easy to end up in propagation failure hell here or change something else that blows things up for use cases that are not foreseen 

Just to clarify you made the DTPE handle exceptions the same way as CassandraDaemon by updating it to use NBHS instead of CSLS Did you just tell me to go fuck myself 

 1 damn intellij it s not like patch format hasn t been standard for years 

Wow it s like Thrift is going out of their way to make life suck for us this month 

Here is quite bad 

 The samples you gave are different 

I just noticed your public tweet bq wilhelmbierbaum True Fuck the Avro C API 

if so can you see if you can git bisect this bad boy 

It seems some of the wrappers in ink hrtime h might no longer be used either e g ink gettimeofday is never used so lets get rid of that shit 

Heh that s one hell of a bug 275 bytes exactly eh 

What a stupid name I chose for that object 

I think it s time to just close this issue 

I m not entering bogus reports for the hell of it Matt

I am currently trying to get it into AJDT dev builds but my git push is timing out damn thing 

Stupid Maven

Ok Stupid user Error here 

Why the hell do they deliver Duration if they cannot instantiate it 

The defect from hell 666 be scared 

This really sucks 

Why the hell is this not a bug 

What the hell are you waiting for 

I suspect it has nothing to do with the file system connector or Infinispan connectors and is simply a stupid mistake in the federated join processor 

I m an idiot 

It really sucks that there is now way currently to include transitive dependencies 

I m an idiot there s nothing wrong with the readme txt 

Crap forgot to verify that this is inconsistant with MRI it s not 

Please close as this is just me being stupid 

Holy hell I think I found one problem with turning a bignum into anything else 

This sucks so much 

Damn I would close this out from the fix to JBSEAM 3742 except the quartz and seampay examples use a custom XML namespace and the XML schema validator is not happy with that 

 Damn I forgot 

Also your username was stupidly named and confusing so I deleted it and created a new one more appropriate 

Damn it seemed it didn t work 

It sucks to lose the code readability but it seems like a reasonable price to pay 

I don t have to ensure that the classloader knows groovy classes you must do that 

And debugging is hell because the test environment needs to have the exact same loader setup 

who the hell starts using our jira for typing lessons 

fuck u

Hell this is gonna take me a lot of work to raise 

That irritated the hell out of me too but I didn t realise it was configurable in the launch file 

This sucks badly 

Why on earth does createLink need a request 

Finally closing this bug from hell 

I sure as hell don t want to start attaching models for the sake of detaching them directly afterwards 

That sucks why isn t the escape mechanism working 

I am an idiot this was a dupe of GUVNOR 84

Sun RI sucks why the hell is saveState and restoreState not called with with javax faces STATE SAVING METHOD server 

Swear to god I m not a total idiot 

I don t know how the hell my diff program decided to add seemingly random CR chars but I ve removed them now 

durrrh that sucks 

Im stuck with IE6 unfortunately 

What the hell I ll give this a shot 

 quote searcher getAtomicReader getSortedDocValues uniqueKey quote This is a performance killer 

As far as the query shit i have no idea if solrdispatchfilter or whatever could should do Thread currentThread setName x or whatever and maybe restore after 

BTW This is one reason why I hate this autoboxing shit since Java 5 I would love to have a way to prevent it in code forbidden checks should detect this somehow 

Hmm that sucks 

tricky shit man I think I found the issue 

Oh man it s a fucking precendence problem 

Ugh well that sucks 

I didn t know we needed to retain backwards config capability across 3 x to 4 x That sucks and it ll make old code stick around longer 

bq this is solr s fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit 

That sounds like some serious buck passing 

This whole thing is very distressing to me 

I think we all know it just sucks 

though I disagree with a signficant amount of statements you made I don t think we would ever come to agreement anyway 

 that s some freaky shit 

I think you made mistakes in ivy xml 

This is where it gets confusing 

If I can give you one advice on this one I d say this fuck Derby use H2 instead as the default embedded database 

What the hell 

 Do nothing Are you serious about that 

 Oleg please accept that my logical is different from your logical 

So I m fine with your logic but given that I don t understand it please don t get upset when I ask questions on how I have to use it 

This was my bad 

The rest are totally unrelated 

Oh fuck Sorry Not my day more beer needed 

Sorry I guess I m against never computing this shit because you guys think returning NaN is ok 

 if you want to make these optimizations fix the APIs so its intuitive otherwise no way 

who the fuck is asking for scores but not the max score and why does their insanely specialized use case justify all these booleans on a central lucene class 

I don t care about code duplication here 

 We should not invoke the global synced fieldnumbers shit for every element only when the setting actually changes

I disagree and I guess I m willing to go to bat for this 

HOLY SHIT 

 I think the comments here are a bad sign I sent us down an unfortunate slippery slope we are a search engine library don t put shit in the index directory or we will delete your shit dead simple 

I wholeheartedly agree this API is confusing as hell 

Not only it s the first one in my life I m seeing multiple ways of closing the same thing it also conceals programming errors 

Sucks to rush a commit when an issue is under discussion 

I m against such heavy committing myself without some consensus to do so 

I m confused 

 I hated that aspect of working for commercial companies 

My bad 

My bad 

Igor is an idiot and we do need gmake 

Shit I missed a cast 

But even if it wasn t it would be totally worthless where it is at 

This is clearly bad webserver behaviour 

Forget what I made D8067 

PreCommit HDFS Build is stuck 

So it is stuck somewhere 

I don t want one offs like this to become lost and forgotten 

But now that I think about it it may crap out when coming back to read even on a recovered file 

 Matt I m an idiot I used the wrong patch Sigh 

I m however very interested in this feature as it is essential to me 

bq this is solr s fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit 

Holy complicated as shit algorithm Batman The complexity of our implementation vs the complexity of what we re actually doing is starting to worry me here 

It also happens at the very startup after he has loaded only 3 sstables hence DataTracker likely have 3 sstables not a shit load 

Shit my bad The posted patch is from a completely wrong branch of my git repo I had not realized I ran the test patch against a branch not branch 1 

 In this particular case Hoss clearly intended to use the no no word as an intensifier and not to stir shit 

Maybe only one of us should play lawyer and the other one play engineer 

 I used to be the latter but then I went to law school and got a degree in this shit 

Then to make matters worse since the mid 1990 s I ve been offering pro bono advice to non profit foundations whose members insult me regularly and assume I m an amateur 

Someone but I m not sure who owes me a public apology here Larry 

Shit there is an dependency Please go to Preferences LDAP Entry Editor and enable the option Show operational attributes 

that s bad Content Type from gSOAP 

Pull it back in if you think different 

Hmm this is quite bad 

You are messing down deep below hbase in dfs 

Damn it sry lost the orientation 

Oh my stupid 

oh geez I m an idiot 

 jira I wish you didn t suck so much 

Indeed that would be VERY bad design 

My bad 

 How bad is this 

I m confused 

This is pretty trivial 

Of course it could DOH 

Then you re pretty well screwed 

Damn Chuck is scary 

This is bad 

Well that sucks 

Bad memory 

The state stuck at Allocated state It is a dup of 3788 

This is a pretty awful bug 

Replaced patch with fix to catch more bad variables

Does this suck 

Of course StrFieldSource is a private class No it s not 

CSS is really confusing sometimes 

Django is a fullstack framework Click is not 

My bad 

Credit of course goes to Dick 

It seems really confusing 

 1 for this my bad 

Hell or high water 

 1 to jar hell 

That would suck 

If so a test that succeeds with errors is confusing as hell 

If the different segments are somewhat homogeneous then these stats should pretty much be very close anyway 

This is pretty trivial just adds three asserts to TestPath testNormalize 

I doubt that Squid is so bad at it 

It s not too bad once CacheConfig is in 

Not too bad though since clearing out commitlog segments is easily done 

ah my bad 

My bad had a typo in the subscription e mail 

My bad 

Yep my bad 

Pull it back in if you think different 

Tabs are evil 

I looked at our distributed pom xml and they re pretty obscure 

once per every bad disk 

Hell UnaryFunction might even be faster than all of these calls in a row 

This was very bad documented 

Damn 

Pull it back in if you think different 

Ie both at are bad 

durrrh that sucks 

My bad 

I m an idiot 

Splitting an existing sub shard gets stuck up 

This is bad 

Oopps bad move 

the recommendation in the wiki is bad 

My bad 

I m starting to think of DLL Hell 

 there were a hell of a bigger problem though as we were blocked in the executor until the SearchRequest was totally processed all the responses were enqueued 

Fix bad patch

Logger on top of Log4J and its abstract base class for supporting other frameworks 

My bad 

Well either you query the database every damn time and your plugin tool code will be super slow 

Damn it 

Hudson seems to be stuck on this 

My bad 

which is silly bad package encapsulation 

My bad 

Oops had a bad comparator in the TestCLI config 

My bad 

The food is very bad 

 gmcdonald my bad 

My bad 

My bad 

Pull it back in if you think different 

Aaarrggh how stupid of mine to have a System out again 

Hell UnaryFunction might even be faster than all of these calls in a row 

I always get the same stupid error 

Damn maven 

I don t care if everything is pretty or not but we should at least support basic admin functionality in IE IMO though I have not used it for years for just about anything 

I ve looked at what can be done within the NSIS framework we use to build the Windows installer 

A feature with wrong functionality is as bad as if not worse than a bad performance 

Doh 

Doh 

Sounds weird to me Could you package a totally 

Am I doing something stupid here 

 Replaced TreeMap with an Array of final Segment objects now very slightly faster than trunk Rebased for trunk Removed the patch renaming SSTableReaderTest to SegmentedFileTest I didn t remove the builder pattern because the alternative seems pretty ugly copying the segments array for every append 

HADOOP 2949 If tarball is specified HOD no longer validates for the pkgs directory in gridservice hdfs or mapred sections as these are not going to be used anyway 

It must be lost somewhere 

Too bad we can t use position fixed in IE6 

I think the correct resolution is to ensure that the prefix stack mechanism gets reset each time the XMLReader is used 

This is always a really bad way to design software 

It may suck but at least I won t be the one bringing in a dumb dependency to a logging library 

How on earth is it buggy 

I didn t do that because that seems bad in hive so I returned null from the operation 

This sucks 

They don t vote they whine that something or everything sucks 

Damn dyslexia 

Damn it 

Doing it at the hackathon you d have a few fellas at your shoulder to give you pointers should you get stuck 

Ah that was my bad 

My bad 

it s my bad 

My bad 

Ah too bad 

Damn Chuck is scary 

Here is quite bad 

This name gets confusing with all of our prenamed Worker and Master classes 

 release of the framework 

I m a pretty strong 0 on this 

Not pretty 

That s pretty unlikely 

Pretty much everything that FSNamesystem ie 

Kind of sucks 

Since this patch is so damn large already I won t be making anymore changes to this other than critical blocker bug fixes 

But please don t say that my reasoning is bad because it is not 

 We can t let fear of back compat prevent us from making progress 

I really don t care 

I am planning to use this framework for some new RPCs I am adding 

Don t hate me just throwing this out there 

Weird 

This is weird 

Gav Hoping I m not teaching you how to suck eggs 

For those of us who don t care about ivy in fact lose something a easy to build hbase 

Where on earth are you anyway 

My bad 

My bad this is already done 

That is bad 

Filling diags log is bad mojo since it s never rotated 

How bad is it 

My bad 

My bad 

Bad IE 

Bad 

Pull it back in if you think different 

Stupid user error 

Weird 

That s weird 

Actually I don t want to specify the encoding because I don t care how the data is transported to me 

And boy hell broke loose So the biggest issue I m facing is indeed with Random sharing across threads 

I don t care what we do as long as we don t change the attributes in JSP significantly 

The Async API in http client 4 x really sucks 

 Forget the patch for the moment 

I ll just put fix in under this issue 

Please forget last comment it is incorrect 

umm call me crazy but why are we making this public 

 cmccabe oh hell no 

Damn 

I d say to hell with windows minority 

Because we don t care for this in cases where we there is no node that is down 

The eclipse ui was completly stuck which was similiar to the other experinces 

My bad 

Juhani my bad i was mistaken 

My Bad 

That s my bad 

Seeking back is pretty inefficient in DFS 

Doh 

Hudson is stuck 

Weird 

Weird 

That s weird 

If that would be the case this would be bad design 

This just seems really evil 

It may cause conflicts but if your intent is to break system security you probably don t care 

My bad uploaded the wrong patch 

I just hate having no clue what a file is really depending on 

Ah damn I thought it was fixed Guillaume 

I abbreviated the heck out of my arguments and thinking but damn it thats what I think 

A stupid bug in a patch that is already applied 

In this case data would pretty much just silently be lost 

This whole thing is really pretty trivial 

An output connector should also have a say in what URLs it will accept 

Turning off hints is basically intended as a oh shit something is broken with hints let s turn it off switch 

why on earth would it match anything you have not even touched the Apache install 

If someone wants to take this over that s cool I m unlikely to have time in the next week and a half though 

It is a nasty bug that I ve seen in real life though 

Yes exactly sorry to be so unclear 

I m not sure what the problem is but the behavior at least in 0 1 4 is that the isClosed AtomicBoolean is not being set to closed in a timely manner 

Sorry for the delay and thanks for the good work works like a charm 

Sorry I thought submit patch was the way to attach a patch 

I don t have very much experience on branch 1 would you like to take a shot at the port 

Especially I don t know very much about the test framework differences 

I will figure out the details and do the port later this week if you don t get to it first 

sorry unassigning myself from this backport 

Another backport for a different jira of mine is failing and I want to see if I can figure out what might be wrong there before doing a new backport 

To upgrade to a recent version of Jackrabbit see http wiki apache org jackrabbit BackupAndMigration I m afraid I can t say much about the risk 

I ve tried something similar I removed the handlers and kept the readers but the performance was not visible 

The responder seemed to be a bottleneck 

But it was not the only issue we also want to manage priorities between the tasks but we need to read them to get enough information to make the right priorities 

While creating the DerbyTest I did notice that this problem is caused by the Database pool because it tries to connect to the database in the background 

Sorry fiberlijun havent had a chance to look at it yet 

 I could not get what KEYWORD means 

I am checking out the dojo fixes and patching them in sorry for the delay it has been a long time 

 then we don t save IO by limiting the buffer size to 1 KB I m confused by this 

Seems to be failing for a different reason now testContainerLaunch org apache hadoop yarn server nodemanager TestLinuxContainerExecutorWithMocks Time elapsed 0 523 sec FAILURE 

Sorry for all the issue mails I forgot to mention the second 2 There is commented source in the test should it be enabled or removed 

I m very sorry 

Sorry guys I was the reason for this trouble 

I should have been very careful before doing this 

My bad forgot to include the test file in the patch Resubmitting in a second 

 sorry 

Damn 

Git is tricky that way 

Sigh I don t like this overall if can t reuse everywhere 

Sorry to let you lose a wild goose chase 

You are going to kill me when I say this but it seems like we should just commit your first patch 

This half reuse is more confusing for new devs who see this code for the first time 

Sorry probably a misunderstanding from my side 

I meet the same problem on Eclipse recently but haven t figured out how to get through 

Sorry Chris I missed it done 

One of the error is that hiddenActivations cannot be resolved 

I m very busy for the moment so I didn t know when I d be able to the change myself so if you can your contribution would be one more time really appreciated 

Oh I didn t consider one flow like after the edit log conversion immediately store failed 

I misunderstood the case and sorry for the confusion 

Aside from the job succeeding it doesn t what effect should I be able to measure in order to see if this is doing anything 

You misunderstood the response StopFilter indeed did not change 

You would need to implement session resume thats a whole new can of worms 

Sorry for a mess in uploaded files my connection got broken during first upload 

Here are 2 patches one for adjustExamplePaths bat sh and the other a new file holding 2 User Libraries UIMA LIB UIMA AS LIB Not sure where this should go 

i found the class so there is no bug sorry

I was not aware of being required to call that method 

This is a silly one 

Seems we didn t enforce an exec for sh but we did for fs 

The patch should be relatively trivial but like I said I have no idea if there is other important stuff going on there or not 

Igor sorry it took me so long to get back to this 

Hey sorry I did not get back to you sooner 

I found the sad attempt at a script you asked about and uploaded it to MAPREDUCE 4282 

Sorry for the delay 

I don t have resources to hand to test this at mo 

Yes it is a dup thanks Mike for taking care of this I planned to do this yesterday but didn t make it 

Forgot to add that I also tried this with and without HBASE 5864

but app developers should always explicitly set it based on their application My guess is that a large enough group of people take the defaults that it matters 

App developers never do what they should 

problem the bit to sign the source release is being called when the source release isn t being built because the source release is only built at the executionroot 

Excuse me for stolen assignement 

In current version the same error cause different messages because there are many commiters 

Sorry for the missing class src java org apache jdo tck lifecycle StateTransitionsReturnedObjects java 

Sorry if this was not clear and yes by blank I meant an empty string 

Qianshi is working on the SSL session reuse but this buggy Bug system does not allow him assign this ticket sigh

Hi Guillaume I did not have an answer right away so I sent you question to Leonard Rosenthol 

Sorry should have commented on this much sooner 

It is not yet tested I ran into strange build problems with APR 

Done sorry for all the mess on a simple patch 

Secondly reading this code I can see why this bug is happening after completing stage 2 above when adding the new item the code does ordered cancelled quantity which equates to 1 1 0 

Keep repeating this and the problem just gets worse 

Please ignore attachment id 6938 

It was attached to the wrong bug 

 back from holidays so a bit delayed but I confirm Andrzej s suggestion a plain text only summarized is ideal for clustering for example 

HTML is quite uncomfortable to work with 

Hi Marco I changed the name of patch because it was made in Java earliar sorry for inconvenience 

Sorry for the mistake 

Not sure I want the transient inability to clean up some local log or other trivial task to kill a whole pig job 

First guess something s getting confused about reversed ness 

Sorry I took Martin s comment to mean the patch was committed and issue closed which certainly discarded all the patches the first time around 

I don t know what just happened 

The patch went to the wrong bug 

Sorry again 

Our caller may not notice what happend right now
