suggestions comprehensive an incredibly solid start there are some quirks and bugs that aren t suuuper major and an overall lack of features but the base here is startlingly fresh and good the lack of gesture support and more icon customization as well as a way to hide the settings page tucking it away in a gesture overflow menu somewhere or separate app shortcut make it difficult to leave nova launcher here are my suggestions and what it would take to make me switch customize app icons on long press individually applying a theme is great but they rarely cover 100 of all apps and the inconsistency drives me mad gesture support i love being able to swipe down anywhere and pulling down my notification shade or swiping up for my app drawer etc customization of panels i d like to be able to decide if i want a full apps list or the launcher settings and be able to decide where they are located i have already purchased the pro key so i m excited to see if these features get implemented i currently run a custom setup i made for myself in nova launcher mimicking the google now aesthetic but having it in launcher form would be 10x better good luck

gets the job done i was a handyshopper user and although i miss being able to record aisles and prices for many stores for one item i love that i can add something to the shopping list with my phone and my husband can see it immediately on his phone i also like that out of milk has a web site where i can build a list so when i m planning meals for the week i can be building the list too using a regular keyboard i see the value of the pantry option i ll probably be using it to keep an inventory of our freeer and our spices i would like to see a way to add items to more than one list for example i d like chips to be on the costco list and the snack list so if i m shopping at one store and see a great price i d know i needed chips overall thisi app gets the job done and it s popularity makes me think the features i want may be added some day

 easy to use and simple but miss some features like changing color or font for multiple nodes

offline browsing please allow us to open local html or swf files there are few browsers out there that can not play local html but those lack the browsing playing features of this app

a beautiful and efficient app with one glaringly annoying flaw this is what got me to a smartphone in the first place and it remains the best of the best i miss the labs features but i like the current incarnation thanks for putting the scale bar back in but why does it disappear a map especially one that zooms and pans needs a scale bar keep it visible and i can give you back that 5th star

nice but it is nice but when it log we cannot take picture

great app but not perfect if i were reviewing comixology the service i d give it five stars however this is for the android app and for that i can only give it three i d used the ipad app with it s great hd support which is lacking on some android tablets that s not a major issue but the biggest drawback to the app is the lack of sd support a majority of tablets have the option for sd cards expanding their storage space and many apps can take advantage of it it s a shame comixology s app hasn t been able to do this yet i don t know if it s concerns over security if someone could take the books on the card and copy them elsewhere but seriously it s easy enough to copy files from system memory if you look it up give users the option to save to sd cards and this review will jump to five stars

what if you added a feature to estimate your calories when i miss a day always horrible the app assumes i ate nothing that day and my weekly nutrition does not include that day the ability to assume an average of calories based on previous days would be incredibly helpful

good app great launcher i really like it but it is killing my battery 

great alarm but has new bug making it use lots of battery i like this alarm i definitely like being able to wake up to a random playlist but since an update its now using massive amounts of battery using the gps i m guessing it s something to do with sunrise feature i don t use the sunrise alarm and i certainly don t move between countries enough for it to constantly be updating so either a setting to not allow access to gps or to only update once a day would be useful otherwise i ll have to go back to the standard alarm until it s fixed

excellent app but drains battery this app works really well and does exactly what s it says it does the only problem i had was that it drained my battery a lot cause it is constantly running

there is room for improvement the good thing it lets you know when your moga pro has been connected to your android device and it displays current games that support the controller the bad thing a its interface it s boring even my 14yr old cousin can make it look like tegra zone based stylish themed or better b the bluetooth connection when i m using the game the controller loses the connection with it for too long so i have to press the moga button and try to reconnect or it happens for a few seconds and while i m using the controller my notification keeps showing the controller has been connected to my tablet c the moga pivot connects the controller to the android device but why on earth does it not display the controller battery life how much longer can my controller s built in battery last it should let me know d just let me know whenever a new game has support for the controller i m talking about pivot running in the background self updating its catalog and pushing a notification warning me a new game has entered the supported games list it d be great e sometimes the controller takes too long to connect what s with the hold up please fix these issues they are worth a new update
