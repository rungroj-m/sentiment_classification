4,stackoverflow,Don t use ,-1
5,stackoverflow,However when I try to run FILE NAME it gives The system cant find the path specified error for the batch file ,-1
6,stackoverflow,Problem without zooming the added content doesn t get visible ,-1
7,stackoverflow,in a application you can workaround with scaling the window size but in an applet I wasn t able to solve that problem ,-1
8,stackoverflow,else your GUI will be Hanged ,-1
9,stackoverflow,I am not sure about Map implementation in HazelCast ,-1
10,stackoverflow,But the above code doesn t work outside the FILE NAME JavaAgent FILE NAME of the main Agent ,-1

12,stackoverflow,I am not sure why I can not get it to work and have been struggling with it for a while ,-1
13,stackoverflow,the problem is the following ,-1
14,stackoverflow,When I run my client it throws the following exception ,-1
15,stackoverflow,i did come across the same issue with Java API NAME works in JDKNUMBER ,-1
16,stackoverflow,I am unsure how to return an array that will avoid returning CODE FRAGMENT as an element of that array ,-1
17,stackoverflow,This is the first time I ve encountered something like below ,-1
18,stackoverflow,NOT WORKING directly compiled the src on Unix machine and used FILE NAME files ,-1
19,stackoverflow,For some mystic reason the workflow is not enetering if Same exact code runs perfectly if I directly paste FILE NAME files from Eclipse s bin folder ,-1
20,stackoverflow,It might not reproduce consistently but at one point you might see the issue again ,-1
21,stackoverflow,Still that does not guarantee that the first thread will run and only then the second one will check if the size 0 ,-1
22,stackoverflow,Eclipse error Failed to create the Java Virtual Machine ,-1
23,stackoverflow,But unfortunately it can not be used ,-1

33,stackoverflow,A workaround might be to use reflection however this isn t a generally recommended approach for a number of reasons brittleness performance problems breaking encapsulation etc ,-1
34,stackoverflow,That can hide an error and keep you searching for dogs a whole week while the problem was really a cat ch ,-1
35,stackoverflow,AS I know it s impossible in the case ,-1
36,stackoverflow,It is not advisable to avoid an exception with an empty catch block even though you are completely sure that is not going to fail under any circumstance ,-1
37,stackoverflow,You are really asking too much of the Java runtime and Jackson library by trying to make them infer all the required information about the type to be instantiated based on the parameterized return ,-1
38,stackoverflow,Server not starting in Eclipse Gallileo IDE with WAS7 ,-1
39,stackoverflow,Your API NAME is messed up and doesn t list dependencies properly ,-1
40,stackoverflow,Without that information you have to start the debugging process by guessing ,-1
41,stackoverflow,so I m not happy with it ,-1
42,stackoverflow,Connections on the other hand are expensive and need to be managed carefully by the application ,-1
43,stackoverflow,i try to return an output type date in a web service but i receive a weird result ,-1
44,stackoverflow,My previous code example used CODE FRAGMENT to fuse the filter and map operations but this was cumbersome and provided no advantage ,-1

53,stackoverflow,I am not able to find any documentation or info ,-1
54,stackoverflow,I tried to download API NAME file but I am not getting the file on net ,-1
55,stackoverflow,I found API NAME but that is for Ubuntu and not for Windows ,-1
56,stackoverflow,I find this error when I am trying to open this file ,-1
57,stackoverflow,There are many errors in this code ,-1
58,stackoverflow,Used wrong column names which does not exist in the table ,-1
59,stackoverflow,It s ugly and inefficient but it should work ,-1
60,stackoverflow,Anyway their current behavior does not allow what you want ,-1
61,stackoverflow,It seems that there must be some problem when genereting the response ,-1
62,stackoverflow,I can successfully call my service but when generating the response it seems to crash ,-1
63,stackoverflow,But as far as I create the entitymanager which not necessary has anything to do with the response it crashes I still respond with just 200 ,-1
64,stackoverflow,The following warning messages should be ignored they are false positive alert messages ,-1
65,stackoverflow,Since this afternoon it have started to give an error and the process ends leaving to process thousands of files ,-1
66,stackoverflow,Its a little complicated there is a full example in this loadNativeLibrary method ,-1
67,stackoverflow,Here is an example I don t understand ,-1
68,stackoverflow,Bear in mind that the above code might not compile I haven t tried it out myself ,-1
69,stackoverflow,Not sure why but I am getting following error from my FILE NAME ,-1
70,stackoverflow,The important different between these two approaches is that with the multi threaded example there s no guarantee of processing order ,-1
71,stackoverflow,since a day I have a very annoying problem I can t run any Spring MVC application Today I have tried to write something basing at Spring Documentation ,-1
72,stackoverflow,Any idea what i might be doing wrong ,-1
73,stackoverflow,I think that you have a problem described in this bug report ,-1
74,stackoverflow,Someone on StackOverflow had similar problem ,-1
75,stackoverflow,i am trying with Jackson but im getting no suitable output ,-1
76,stackoverflow,I m a little worried that they use a busy waiting mechanism as it would produce a lot of overhead ,-1
77,stackoverflow,I don t want to get the last token and reuse it for the next query it does not make a sense since I want to use batch ,-1
78,stackoverflow,Less margin for error ,-1
79,stackoverflow,Wrong CODE FRAGMENT CODE FRAGMENT attribute ,-1
80,stackoverflow,I was unable to get a perfect match ,-1
81,stackoverflow,I am not able to deploy my App Engine project locally ,-1
82,stackoverflow,You absolutly need to be compiling FILE NAME JRE NUMBER ,-1
83,stackoverflow,There is of course an API for the DRL compiler s parser but it isn t stable and as complex as DRL rule syntax which is considerable ,-1
84,stackoverflow,I m having trouble figuring out how to do this in drools 6 ,-1
85,stackoverflow,But this refernce doesn t solve my problem ,-1
86,stackoverflow,This is an absurd unreasonable and frankly ridiculous requirement I can t imagine what use such a data structure would be good for ,-1
87,stackoverflow,First of all I do not think you need all these ,-1
88,stackoverflow,This means it was not possible to resolve the dependencies of the API NAME to the API NAME ,-1
89,stackoverflow,But now I think the problem is JNA creats temp files for the native librarys wit jna prefix and a unique generated numeric value ,-1
90,stackoverflow,then I gets the module error again from JNA ,-1
91,stackoverflow,This line gives the error ,-1
92,stackoverflow,I am using standout library I added a videoView in it Everything is running correctly Except if i click on video then mediaController Is not Showing and i am getting null pointer exception ,-1
93,stackoverflow,And an CODE FRAGMENT argument type can never accept a CODE FRAGMENT ,-1

100,stackoverflow,They all fail with the following error ,-1
101,stackoverflow,The following is the error I keep getting ,-1
102,stackoverflow,But it isn t working like I expected ,-1
103,stackoverflow,But unexpectedly I am getting 66 ,-1
104,stackoverflow,As an aside configuring the CODE FRAGMENT that is created by the CODE FRAGMENT is not supported ,-1
105,stackoverflow,Why is it reading it wrongly ,-1
106,stackoverflow,The error is as shown below ,-1
107,stackoverflow,Exception in thread main API NAME Uncompilable source code Erroneous tree type ,-1
108,stackoverflow,I don t know if it is possible to show timer on cards ,-1
109,stackoverflow,The problem is that when reader contains CODE FRAGMENT it is not reporting ready ,-1
110,stackoverflow,I tried the following and it returns nothing ,-1
111,stackoverflow,I searched a lot but i not found any solution ,-1
112,stackoverflow,What I don t understand is if one thread is still stuck deadlocked inside CODE FRAGMENT then how come all the other threads were able to get past the CODE FRAGMENT call ,-1
113,stackoverflow,When I tried to compile the tool I get n error ,-1
114,stackoverflow,I don t know what else to do to make things to work ,-1
115,stackoverflow,I think the actual CODE FRAGMENT would be a little more complicated to simplify ,-1
116,stackoverflow,I have created a custom MenuBar in my Processing sketch using Eclipse as my IDE but it is not displaying ,-1
117,stackoverflow,I expected there to be a CODE FRAGMENT Menu in the CODE FRAGMENT but there is none ,-1

119,stackoverflow,But it s not necessary for our case ,-1
120,stackoverflow,Java JTextPane JScrollPane Display Issue ,-1
121,stackoverflow,I suspect there may not be a good solution for this right now ,-1
122,stackoverflow,I thought that the problem was the id null ,-1
123,stackoverflow,I haven t used EclipseLink myself so all I can do is guess but what surprises me is that FILE NAME doesn t have a setter for the id property ,-1
124,stackoverflow,I learned that such beans are proxied using CGLib but still can not figure out how proxy can handle thread ,-1
125,stackoverflow,This is your problem ,-1
126,stackoverflow,This is not my intention ,-1
127,stackoverflow,I guess my approach is wrong so I d appreciate some guidance ,-1
128,stackoverflow,This isn t valid Java ,-1
129,stackoverflow,Well the funny part is we do not know ,-1
130,stackoverflow,The data structure you are saving your data is not very optimal for the days with daylight saving time ,-1
131,stackoverflow,This is part of the code which was working fine and now it s not ,-1
132,stackoverflow,The exception is throw on CODE FRAGMENT ,-1
133,stackoverflow,I ve notice that some of the feeds had false value ,-1
134,stackoverflow,The problem is that you wrote ,-1
135,stackoverflow,I wrote this code to update a patient in a derby database but it throws a CODE FRAGMENT ,-1
136,stackoverflow,I understand why you tried CODE FRAGMENT but with the fix above we no longer need that we can just declare it CODE FRAGMENT ,-1
137,stackoverflow,Your CODE FRAGMENT method calls itself recursively leading to an infinite recursion ,-1
138,stackoverflow,CGLIB proxy did not work for my case ,-1
139,stackoverflow,Problems creating JAXBContext to marshal object as XML ,-1
140,stackoverflow,I m about to hang myself with the little rope I have left ,-1
141,stackoverflow,Here is a demo for the naive implementation which doesn t work ,-1
142,stackoverflow,Because it s not initialized yet ,-1
143,stackoverflow, So the problem is CODE FRAGMENT ,-1
144,stackoverflow,I need all subclasses to execute CODE FRAGMENT but I can t rely on them doing it explicitly ,-1
145,stackoverflow,Since this is correct why byte code noting down the return type of the called method and raising error when the library is updated with a return type for the method ,-1
146,stackoverflow,Data loss ,-1
147,stackoverflow,When I run the project I get the following error ,-1
148,stackoverflow,As you can see the translucent text is clearly standard AA and rather than a clean translucent rendering it has that awful 90s spidery appearance ,-1
149,stackoverflow,As others have stated this is not an issue with JPA hibernate but rather with the json serialization library you are using ,-1
150,stackoverflow,We ran into the same sort of problem with Flex and JPA Hibernate ,-1

155,stackoverflow,It s not possible using the Selenium WebDriver API ,-1
156,stackoverflow,I have read the Doc but i am not clear what is meant by CODE FRAGMENT ,-1
157,stackoverflow,Annotations like CODE FRAGMENT and CODE FRAGMENT will not work unless you process them yourself and invoke the appropriate methods ,-1
158,stackoverflow,There is a caveat with the above approach ,-1
159,stackoverflow,It says that you dont export the JUnit Library into the build and if the build relies on the functionality of that lib there might occur CNF Exceptions ,-1
160,stackoverflow,If I run the code in the GUI it just hangs ,-1
161,stackoverflow,I have looked and found that there are some packages that would automatically enter my keyring on login but that isn t really an option ,-1
162,stackoverflow,When I first saw it I was horrified ,-1
163,stackoverflow,Drawback of above approach not using copy of data is that thread safety is harder to achieve though ,-1
164,stackoverflow,This code failed ,-1
165,stackoverflow,You can not supply system properties to the API NAME tool unfortunately ,-1
166,stackoverflow,I have found out that certain misconfigured servers send an Unrecognized Name warning in the SSL handshake which is ignored by most clients except for Java ,-1
167,stackoverflow,You can t open CODE FRAGMENT with CODE FRAGMENT ,-1
168,stackoverflow,This is an issue with how volley handles HTTPUrlConnection and retry policy ,-1
169,stackoverflow,So it s basically in the wrong form ,-1
170,stackoverflow,Avoid them ,-1
171,stackoverflow,This may or may not work ,-1
172,stackoverflow,On Facebook i ran in to a problem ,-1
173,stackoverflow,The result was the same that i don t have the correct permissions ,-1

175,stackoverflow,And now my app is getting it s app Token and i can use it to publish messages but the problem is those messages can not be viewed on the app page it self ,-1
176,stackoverflow,There s no way to do that AFAIK ,-1
177,stackoverflow,You can t suspend a thread like that ,-1
178,stackoverflow,Perfect would be to have in my CODE FRAGMENT ,0
179,stackoverflow,and then override this with CODE FRAGMENT so that I could do ,0
180,stackoverflow,Define your production environment as default profile in your API NAME ,0
181,stackoverflow,You can setup your API NAME as filtered resource and have this value filled by maven from maven profile settings that what we do ,0
182,stackoverflow,Now you can use ,0
183,stackoverflow,About setting default production profile already posted andih ,0
184,stackoverflow,So I do the following ,0
185,stackoverflow,Many thanks ,0
186,stackoverflow,Use this construct ,0
187,stackoverflow,According to docs ,0
188,stackoverflow,the way this projects i associated is ,0
189,stackoverflow,In your FILE NAME CODE FRAGMENT has not been set and therefore is CODE FRAGMENT ,0
190,stackoverflow,I am trying to use JNDI for the JDBC connectivity but it returns NULL DataSource ,0
191,stackoverflow,and hear is the code to connect ,0
192,stackoverflow,Thanks for any help with this ,0
193,stackoverflow,Also what s the difference between wait and await from CountDownLatch ,0
194,stackoverflow,EDIT I guess I need to rephrase my queries ,0
195,stackoverflow,Await as per the docs says ,0
196,stackoverflow,With a CODE FRAGMENT you can easily wait for all of the tasks to be completed ,0
197,stackoverflow,Looking up the documentation is step one of any question ,0
198,stackoverflow,CODE FRAGMENT is an actual function of CODE FRAGMENT whereas CODE FRAGMENT is inherited from CODE FRAGMENT ,0
199,stackoverflow,What I am trying to do ,0
200,stackoverflow,Well I thought I am authorized once I used my API KEY to authorize my access to GoogleBook ,0
201,stackoverflow,I did this like this ,0
202,stackoverflow,Thanks ,0
203,stackoverflow,You should declare CODE FRAGMENT as CODE FRAGMENT ,0
204,stackoverflow,I can draw the circle with a transparent background like this ,0
205,stackoverflow,I am executing a batch file FILE NAME program ,0
206,stackoverflow,I kept the batch file as a resource in the source directory ,0
207,stackoverflow,resources API NAME creation option package required library into FILE NAME ,0
208,stackoverflow,While Java can read JARs and treat them just as the normal file system most other applications can not ,0
209,stackoverflow,Inside FILE NAME that should trigger the batch file put the following ,0
210,stackoverflow,actually it looks smth like this ,0
211,stackoverflow,So try ,0
212,stackoverflow,I am developing some small stuff for google app engine FILE NAME ,0
213,stackoverflow,That means you need to use the Google FILE NAME files ,0
214,stackoverflow,because this API depends on which server tomcat jetty you are using ,0
215,stackoverflow,so it comes with the server ,0
216,stackoverflow,Below are the features of Intellij IDEA ultimate edition ,0
217,stackoverflow,Hope this helps ,0
218,stackoverflow,I m using Apache ftpserver Java ,0
219,stackoverflow,I need to have a nofication in my program when a file is uploaded through the ftp ,0
220,stackoverflow,Any solutions out there ,0
221,stackoverflow,I am assuming that you have a desktop program which is running on the ftpserver itself ,0
222,stackoverflow,Lets see ,0
223,stackoverflow,You can get all notifications using ftplet ,0
224,stackoverflow,While there are modules that need a Spring context since they just wrap parts of the domain model we think that some of our APIs do not ,0
225,stackoverflow,There is a central interface to access this API ,0
226,stackoverflow,So a simple initialization would be ,0
227,stackoverflow,It should mean either of the following two ,0
228,stackoverflow,Or assuming that CODE FRAGMENT is a specific implementation of the CODE FRAGMENT and AInterface is the central access we could just say A uses a certain implementation of BInterface by default and so on and actually set them internally with new ,0
229,stackoverflow,So we re wondering how do other API developers make their interfaces and beans accessible without relying on a context import which btw also clutters up the target context with many potentially unneeded beans like for example if an API provides several services and I only want to use one ,0
230,stackoverflow,But is there a way to have Netbeans automatically connect with API NAME and retrieve these files ,0
231,stackoverflow,Unless you start using Maven or a similar dependency management tool ,0
232,stackoverflow,The name CODE FRAGMENT is a package name and we only use the name of the site as a convention ,0
233,stackoverflow,I have already created a custom access decision voter and using it in a custom access decision manager ,0
234,stackoverflow,Can i use the Object o parameter specified in the vote interface method ,0
235,stackoverflow,Your EntryListener will be called by Hazelcast s internal threads ,0
236,stackoverflow,This can be done by submitting a runnable to an ExecutorService maintained by you ,0
237,stackoverflow,I ve attached a font ,0
238,stackoverflow,This library is attached to a Java Agent ,0
239,stackoverflow,In that agent I can get an inputstream on the font file using this code ,0
240,stackoverflow,Then I changed the client to use jQuery file upload ,0
241,stackoverflow,in order to have a more powerful client with drag and drop ,0
242,stackoverflow,due to which spring dependency injection was working fine and was getting a bean through ,0
243,stackoverflow,But now I have also integrated PowerMock in it ,0
244,stackoverflow,You have to use the PowerMockRule ,0
245,stackoverflow,and you should get the following test results ,0
246,stackoverflow,With this annotation you don t need the PowerMock rule anymore ,0
247,stackoverflow,I added CODE FRAGMENT to my Java Build Path ,0
248,stackoverflow,How could I add FILE NAME files into the CODE FRAGMENT file ,0
249,stackoverflow,First declare it like this ,0
250,stackoverflow,For example if I have an excel sheet populated I can change the value of certain cells while leaving the value of others ,0
251,stackoverflow,Thank you in advance ,0
252,stackoverflow,Yes you can do it nicely using Andy Khan s JExcel library ,0
253,stackoverflow,In order to improve performance data which relates to output information eg ,0
254,stackoverflow,You ll have to write some utility to do this however it is possible to do in JXL ,0
255,stackoverflow,Any help would be appreciated ,0
256,stackoverflow,Here are my classes ,0
257,stackoverflow,You use the simple array with the fix size 5 ,0
258,stackoverflow,It means that if you add more than 5 hobbies it will throw CODE FRAGMENT ,0
259,stackoverflow,The arrays are initialized to CODE FRAGMENT by default which means that if you set less than 5 hobbies you try to call it on CODE FRAGMENT which throws CODE FRAGMENT ,0
260,stackoverflow,So my question now is ,0
261,stackoverflow,Any help here ,0
262,stackoverflow,You will have to come up with a different approach if you expect to make it configurable after deployment ,0
263,stackoverflow,And I m using the following block of code to invoke the service ,0
264,stackoverflow,As the error says ,0
265,stackoverflow,So you must change the signature of your method to ,0
266,stackoverflow,You can not return any thing ,0
267,stackoverflow,It should be solved FILE NAME 8 ,0
268,stackoverflow,Delete with a payload works fine in Jersey clients 2 x x ,0
269,stackoverflow,I e if there are 4 students in the initial array but only 2 are failing my array is returning student1 student2 null null ,0
270,stackoverflow,My current result when I do a test run in main is ,0
271,stackoverflow,You re creating an array that is as long as the original array passed in which fills all elements with null but not necessarily filling all the slots ,0
272,stackoverflow,By default CODE FRAGMENT sets all parameters on the value stack ,0
273,stackoverflow,this is one of the mechanism provides by Struts2 to handle Cross Site Request Forgery CSRF ,0
274,stackoverflow,Have a look at ,0
275,stackoverflow,Say the fruits are apples oranges mangoes etc If the user selects apples I call apples if he selects mangoes I call mangoes and so on To select which function is to be called I Don T want to use a switch or if else statements ,0
276,stackoverflow,How do I select which function is to be called during run time ,0
277,stackoverflow,NOTE The programming language I am using is Java ,0
278,stackoverflow,Use CODE FRAGMENT ,0
279,stackoverflow,Try using equalsIgnoreCase instead of straight CODE FRAGMENT ,0
280,stackoverflow,Multiple Threads Inner classes implementing Runnable sharing a Data Structure instance variable of the FILE NAME ,0
281,stackoverflow,Working took classes from Eclipse project s bin folder ran on a Unix machine ,0
282,stackoverflow,I apologize if I missed anything obvious ,0
283,stackoverflow,Thanks a lot maasg Solution was to add synchronized myArrayList before I check the size in the Thread 2 ,0
284,stackoverflow,To access a shared structure in a multi threaded environment you should use implicit or explicit locking to ensure safe publication and access among threads ,0
285,stackoverflow,Using the code above it should look like this ,0
286,stackoverflow,Using a concurrent data structure lets you get rid of the synchronized block ,0
287,stackoverflow,Check the return of ,0
288,stackoverflow,You could also use ,0
289,stackoverflow,to ensure the arraylist is always synchronised correctly ,0
290,stackoverflow,If I got this right ,0
291,stackoverflow,Depending on what you need to accomplish there might be better other ways to achieve that ,0
292,stackoverflow,Based on the stacktrace your output directory is not empty ,0
293,stackoverflow,A FILE NAME name should be used ,0
294,stackoverflow,In my main method im parsing the command line arguments like this ,0
295,stackoverflow,If I m now running my programm with the following command ,0
296,stackoverflow,Why does it treat this as my output directory ,0
297,stackoverflow,I specified another directory as the output directory ,0
298,stackoverflow,This should read all files in the single input directory ,0
299,stackoverflow,It gives me the Failed to Create the Java Virtual Machine ,0
300,stackoverflow,Every file has same data which is saved into Employee Table ,0
301,stackoverflow,Another option may be the Factory pattern ,0
302,stackoverflow,Of course you can combine both ,0
303,stackoverflow,You could use a kind of strategy ,0
304,stackoverflow,This way you can create new readers for any filetype dynamically ,0
305,stackoverflow,Hope it helps ,0
306,stackoverflow,You would only need parsers and a successor to each parser ,0
307,stackoverflow,In some cases there is a trade that you need to do thus you should take into account your project s requirements ,0

319,stackoverflow,So if you annotate FILE NAME only with CODE FRAGMENT it will not get exported ,0
320,stackoverflow,I am trying to figure out how I could make something that looks like a folder file structure for a Java shell I am trying to make ,0
321,stackoverflow,I want it to resemble something like the linux folder structure having a root and all decending from it ,0
322,stackoverflow,The folders in the tree would be server objects a FILE NAME created by the root the FILE NAME which in turn have application objects FILE NAME created by a method in the server object ,0
323,stackoverflow,In pre java7 simulating an in memory filesystem is fairly complex ,0
324,stackoverflow,Find out more ,0

333,stackoverflow,I the next best thing I ve found so far is to project the byte buffer as a CODE FRAGMENT and call CODE FRAGMENT ,0
334,stackoverflow,What about CODE FRAGMENT and calling CODE FRAGMENT on the returned CODE FRAGMENT ,0
335,stackoverflow,CODE FRAGMENT is made of CODE FRAGMENTs not CODE FRAGMENTs ,0
336,stackoverflow,I feel like there should be some way of doing this with the FILE NAME but I can t figure out a way to use it to get properties from an entity ,0
337,stackoverflow,Thanks in advance ,0
338,stackoverflow,FILE NAME is only useful if you are using standard Java beans naming conventions for accessing the properties of your entity ,0
339,stackoverflow,What you ll want to do is get the CODE FRAGMENT of FILE NAME using the CODE FRAGMENT method then use the CODE FRAGMENT method of the CODE FRAGMENT to retrieve all of the getter methods of the bean ,0
340,stackoverflow,You also do not have to hardcode anything like CODE FRAGMENT or CODE FRAGMENT in your reflective code ,0
341,stackoverflow,This example compiles and runs ,0
342,stackoverflow,This is what I have so far ,0
343,stackoverflow,Then it s up to you to add the relevant code to the method body ,0

360,stackoverflow,User hibernate validation 4 ,0
361,stackoverflow,It is integrated in Hibernate 4 ,0
362,stackoverflow,You do that explicitly but they are also a transitive dependency to hibernate validator so you would get them either way ,0
363,stackoverflow,No that not required related ,0
364,stackoverflow,How do you use all these dependencies ,0
365,stackoverflow,That s the whole purpose of GUIDs ,0
366,stackoverflow,If your GUID is a CODE FRAGMENT then the probabilities are quite low ,0
367,stackoverflow,Any ideas ,0
368,stackoverflow,Also the compiled library is available by adding the following to API NAME ,0
369,stackoverflow,And I see lot of demo and sample code about broadcasting with CODE FRAGMENT ,0
370,stackoverflow,You can try this one WEB ADDRESS ,0
371,stackoverflow,It supports API NAME NUMBER clients ,0
372,stackoverflow,So to send a message to specific socket all you need is to call CODE FRAGMENT ,0
373,stackoverflow,Any tip ,0
374,stackoverflow,You could check whether your CODE FRAGMENT also is an instance of CODE FRAGMENT ,0
375,stackoverflow,thanks in advance ,0
376,stackoverflow,Throw a specific custom exception and set a specific CODE FRAGMENT for that ,0
377,stackoverflow,Lastly if you use tomcat you might want to clear the work directory with the temporary compiler outputs of the jsps you created ,0

392,stackoverflow,Then you can also add additional access paths to the stuff you want ,0
393,stackoverflow,you can use a CODE FRAGMENT ,0
394,stackoverflow,for problem number two are you adding anyting to the list ,0
395,stackoverflow,Now I was thinking of creating FILE NAME progress page which would sleep for 5 seconds then generate a request and supply it with the filename that we want to know the progress of ,0
396,stackoverflow,Maybe JavaScript can do the desired actions ,0
397,stackoverflow,Poll the server requires a progress API periodically via javascript for the processing status and update the page accordingly when you get a positive result ,0
398,stackoverflow,On the client side you check the progress every few seconds until you see it s finished ,0
399,stackoverflow,You can add an onClickListener to the ImageViews in the FILE NAME something like this ,0
400,stackoverflow,Hope that helps ,0
401,stackoverflow,to get this index use getElementIdx col row ,0
402,stackoverflow,Here it is ,0

427,stackoverflow,When the CODE FRAGMENT command fails it s almost always because of one of two things ,0
428,stackoverflow,Make sure FILE NAME dependencies in your manifest file point to jars relative to FILE NAME s parent directory ,0
429,stackoverflow,Ensure FILE NAME contains CODE FRAGMENT or that your manifest hierarchy points to FILE NAME that contains FILE NAME ,0
430,stackoverflow,You should see your CODE FRAGMENT folder there containing all the required dependencies including Apache POI ,0
431,stackoverflow,About having FILE NAME dependencies in a separate folder as you suggested that s also possible ,0
432,stackoverflow,Imagine your dependencies where stored in a CODE FRAGMENT folder outside your CODE FRAGMENT ,0

519,stackoverflow,If they press Enter it should break the While loop and move onto the next statement right ,0
520,stackoverflow,The CODE FRAGMENT method will block until it can read a token ,0
521,stackoverflow,When the line is empty it will return an empty string CODE FRAGMENT not CODE FRAGMENT ,0
522,stackoverflow,you need to have FILE NAME in your classpath in order to reslove this ,0
523,stackoverflow,Here is the FILE NAME ,0
524,stackoverflow,And here is the FILE NAME ,0
525,stackoverflow,I ve separated the loop body into two statements for clarity but it s equivalent to ,0
526,stackoverflow,Your fields should generally be private ,0
527,stackoverflow,Add public getter methods where necessary ,0
528,stackoverflow,and to declare getters and setters for you fields ,0
529,stackoverflow,And in your constructor If you closeley look ,0
530,stackoverflow,I want it to use id instead ,0

536,stackoverflow, users table is located in newly created database ,0
537,stackoverflow,Check the CODE FRAGMENT library in your project ,0
538,stackoverflow,If you see the source code of this method you will see that ,0
539,stackoverflow,This method is intended to just re use the existing array and not allocate any memory ,0
540,stackoverflow,The fact that the size constraint and expansion is only related to CODE FRAGMENT can also be a reason not to add this behaviour to the method ,0
541,stackoverflow,That would just be extra code for the sake of just a particular CODE FRAGMENT implementation ,0
542,stackoverflow,Here is what the content of FILE NAME ended up looking like ,0
543,stackoverflow,What kind of a tool can I use to obfuscate mask away my code similar to NewRelic FILE NAME ,0

565,stackoverflow,but I get a CODE FRAGMENT ,0
566,stackoverflow,You need to escape dot ,0
567,stackoverflow,you have to use CODE FRAGMENT ,0
568,stackoverflow,So I thought I could create FILE NAME that counts and pass the stream through a API NAME code is in this answer ,0
569,stackoverflow,So my Stream was finally ,0
570,stackoverflow,The stream if non parallel could be pass sequentially through all the steps filter map ,0
571,stackoverflow,Short answer ,0
572,stackoverflow,I suspect that s why the language designers made that decision ,0
573,stackoverflow,Why it technically does not work without CODE FRAGMENT ,0
574,stackoverflow,Every intermediate operation of CODE FRAGMENT such as CODE FRAGMENT or CODE FRAGMENT is actually just some kind of setter that initializes the stream s options ,0
575,stackoverflow,This is why CODE FRAGMENT s argument is evaluated before a single item has gone through the first step of the stream ,0
576,stackoverflow,We want parallel treatment of our items ,0
577,stackoverflow,More detailed answer about why not allow it for non parallel streams ,0
578,stackoverflow,I finally found my error ,0
579,stackoverflow,You almost certainly have a firewall or anti virus program blocking your ability to connect ,0
580,stackoverflow,What can be the reason of this warnings ,0

584,stackoverflow,Add this dependency to your API NAME ,0
585,stackoverflow,Write to file ,0
586,stackoverflow,My logcat ,0
587,stackoverflow,Let s take a look at the CODE FRAGMENT method ,0
588,stackoverflow,CODE FRAGMENT is thrown because CODE FRAGMENT is CODE FRAGMENT ,0
589,stackoverflow,If so you should provide CODE FRAGMENT by yourself at it s constructor ,0
590,stackoverflow,An CODE FRAGMENT is ,0
591,stackoverflow,I have a Unix command to send email ,0
592,stackoverflow,Please guide me on this problem ,0
593,stackoverflow,Well no ,0
594,stackoverflow,CODE FRAGMENT against an object checks for reference equality ,0
595,stackoverflow,That is it checks to see if these two objects are literally the same spot in memory ,0
596,stackoverflow,It depends which type of equality do you want ,0
597,stackoverflow,Maybe this way Controller code for the CODE FRAGMENT ,0
598,stackoverflow,CODE FRAGMENT is an extension of CODE FRAGMENT that adds a CODE FRAGMENT status code ,0
599,stackoverflow,Used in CODE FRAGMENT as well CODE FRAGMENT methods ,0
600,stackoverflow,Where Object is FILE NAME you want ,0
601,stackoverflow,I found work around from this post WEB ADDRESS ,0

611,stackoverflow,I have a native library that I call using JNI ,0
612,stackoverflow,A few notes ,0
613,stackoverflow,See NativeSystem ,0
614,stackoverflow,Its always fun when you have concurrent applications extracting different versions of your naive library to the same location and filename ,0
615,stackoverflow,Use API NAME instead of API NAME to load the extracted binaries ,0
616,stackoverflow,Quite contrary on Windows ,0
617,stackoverflow,Check out the documentation for the CODE FRAGMENT here or ,0
618,stackoverflow,It will read a byte each time here ,0
619,stackoverflow,Quote taken from the CODE FRAGMENT documentation ,0
620,stackoverflow,After that the UI thread CODE FRAGMENT receives the message inside the CODE FRAGMENT method ,0
621,stackoverflow,and acts accordingly to the message received and displays the message in your CODE FRAGMENT of choice ,0
622,stackoverflow,On a sidenote ,0
623,stackoverflow,CODE FRAGMENT Terminates the current line by writing the line separator string ,0
624,stackoverflow,This method behaves as though it invokes print String and then println ,0
625,stackoverflow,Note that the byte is written as given to write a character that will be translated according to the platform s default character encoding use the print char or println char methods ,0
626,stackoverflow,Edit Missed to add one imp line CODE FRAGMENT ,0
627,stackoverflow,As to your point ,0
628,stackoverflow,The CODE FRAGMENT will take care of the rest ,0
629,stackoverflow,That shouldn t be an issue though ,0
630,stackoverflow,It is possible to pass VM flags to expand this range too ,0
631,stackoverflow,Just changing the map s value externally does not reorder the priority queue ,0
632,stackoverflow,You will have to remove and add the Object whose score changed for it to move to its new position in the queue ,0
633,stackoverflow,And then for FILE NAME we have ,0
634,stackoverflow,Examples of FILE NAME names include ,0
635,stackoverflow,Otherwise the absolute name is of the following form ,0
636,stackoverflow,modified package name name ,0

643,stackoverflow,And my Gradle File looks like this ,0
644,stackoverflow,where CODE FRAGMENT is your CODE FRAGMENT ,0
645,stackoverflow,If you include the appcompat lib as you do above you don t need to include support v4 at all appcompat depends on it and the build system will do the right thing ,0
646,stackoverflow,So go ahead and remove FILE NAME from your libs folder ,0
647,stackoverflow,I have chosen this as a recurring pattern throughout the project ,0
648,stackoverflow,InsertandRetriveBlobData ,0
649,stackoverflow,Starting with the socket IO since Java 7 the NIO API has been available which means you can leave the threading required to prevent blocking the main thread to the OS ,0
650,stackoverflow,You might also want to look at an API like Netty which I believe saves you from having to write logic to re construct messages ,0
651,stackoverflow,Once you have a complete message you need to process it ,0
652,stackoverflow,Each node in the network sends periodically updated data from sensors voltage current temperature etc ,0

654,stackoverflow,Maybe try put your data into BlockingQueue and in main thread take data ,0
655,stackoverflow,this is FILE NAME to read your data from BlockingQueue ,0
656,stackoverflow,So i created this from scratch ,0
657,stackoverflow,and of course API NAME ,0
658,stackoverflow,it will tell from where to pickup the root API NAME ,0
659,stackoverflow,What am I missing ,0
660,stackoverflow,However you can find the documentation in the OpenJDK source itself ,0
661,stackoverflow,It s documentation can be found here ,0

663,stackoverflow,In a word No ,0
664,stackoverflow,What happens if a thread is interrupted multiple times by different threads ,0
665,stackoverflow,Which one should be reported ,0
666,stackoverflow,You probably to build your own event mechanism in which the events carry the information you need with them ,0
667,stackoverflow,Using this i am able to generate an encrypted text but the PHP server is not able to decrypt my encrypted text ,0
668,stackoverflow,Some other pointer ,0
669,stackoverflow,I am using API NAME for encoding ,0
670,stackoverflow,Working Python Code ,0
671,stackoverflow,I m looking for a well maintained Java bytecode manipulation library with an intuitive API ,0
672,stackoverflow,Take a look at this article ,0
673,stackoverflow,Maybe you could do the same that he did i e explicitly declare rc05 version of Guava to force maven to use this one ,0
674,stackoverflow, see this answer ,0
675,stackoverflow,how do i map FILE NAME to set the values and create a different json with the same format ,0
676,stackoverflow,There is no exact equivalent of a CODE FRAGMENT in JDBC ,0
677,stackoverflow,I am specifically referring to InputStream Java SE and its implementations ,0
678,stackoverflow,How is blocking performed ,0
679,stackoverflow,No they don t use busy waiting ,0
680,stackoverflow,It s up to the implementation which will depend on the kind of input stream you re using but generally it s likely to use a blocking OS level API so the efficiency will depend on the OS ,0
681,stackoverflow,the exception is on line 72 and 114 ,0
682,stackoverflow,Please not that in the above code CODE FRAGMENT method will close not only the CODE FRAGMENT object itself but also its underlining stream i e keyboard input ,0
683,stackoverflow,This means you ve picked up a version built against Hadoop 1 x hence the FILE NAME vs interface exception ,0
684,stackoverflow,One which is the Pro full API ,0
685,stackoverflow,I see some mention of flavours on the net but seems all the hits are to do with Android development and properties ,0
686,stackoverflow,When you build you can publish the binaries for both pro and lite to your artifact repository nexus artifactory etc and then you would have 2 separate jars ,0
687,stackoverflow,A single Gradle project can produce any number of JARs ,0
688,stackoverflow,You could simply add another Jar task and give it a unique classifier to distinguish it from the standard library ,0
689,stackoverflow,Say I have a input field which will only accept a CODE FRAGMENT when the submit button is pressed ,0
690,stackoverflow,You ll need to customize the formatter s CODE FRAGMENT method since NumberFormat normally ignores trailing characters ,0
691,stackoverflow,What I would like to do take any random XML and create object which will contain timestamps integers strings as well maps basically it would be all decomposed based on the XML structure ,0
692,stackoverflow,Is there better way than to do it manually ,0
693,stackoverflow,Component scan configuration file ,0
694,stackoverflow,In a FILE NAME code base in my recent job I see the below code ,0
695,stackoverflow,Are there examples you have that could shed light on the above MapHelper s usefulness ,0
696,stackoverflow,you could use ,0
697,stackoverflow,See also Is there a Java equivalent or methodology for the typedef keyword in C ,0
698,stackoverflow,They appear to have foresight about what the Map contains ,0
699,stackoverflow,There are some examples like this in the Java API such as ,0
700,stackoverflow,Does anyone know what the C equivalents would be for the methods shown above ,0
701,stackoverflow,XmlWriter forward only xml stream generator ,0
702,stackoverflow,The API NAME file code is ,0
703,stackoverflow,When i run this API NAME their shows only the labels and No button aor text field ,0
704,stackoverflow,Wrong JSF tags ,0
705,stackoverflow,In order to avoid such problems in future you d better use some IDE e g Netbeans IDE or Intellij IDEA ,0
706,stackoverflow,Use CDI s CODE FRAGMENT with CODE FRAGMENT or JSF s CODE FRAGMENT with CODE FRAGMENT ,0
707,stackoverflow,You must capitalize the first letter of the property in the getter setter so instead of ,0
708,stackoverflow,Second you are mixing CODE FRAGMENT instantiation through JSF with CODE FRAGMENT ,0
709,stackoverflow,Older versions of JSF used instantiation through JSF and you should be using CODE FRAGMENT ,0
710,stackoverflow,Also to note when asking questions usually it is worth stating which version of JSF server J2EE you are using without such information we can not tell you which annotations you should use ,0
711,stackoverflow,Do i need to use event mechanism ,0
712,stackoverflow,Use CODE FRAGMENT instead and get this string from a CODE FRAGMENT ,0
713,stackoverflow,Check here for an example which returns a String ,0
714,stackoverflow,Like this ,0
715,stackoverflow,If you insist using CODE FRAGMENT you can try the below 2 ways ,0
716,stackoverflow,Can anyone please help me out with this ,0
717,stackoverflow,Hoping to get an alternate approach or a small overview of AnchorPane constraints ,0
718,stackoverflow,Note I m new to JavaFX graphics library ,0
719,stackoverflow,running CODE FRAGMENT isn t enough running CODE FRAGMENT after inserting the dependency solved it for me ,0
720,stackoverflow,I would like to keep that original window open throughout when the user is using the File Chooser and after ,0
721,stackoverflow,The file chooser s parent was the main window ,0
722,stackoverflow,DO NOTHING ON CLOSE defined in WindowConstants Don t do anything require the program to handle the operation in the windowClosing method of a registered WindowListener object ,0
723,stackoverflow,You absolutly need to be compiling FILE NAME JRE NUMBER ,0
724,stackoverflow,I created the simplest possible android app which starts the RegisterActivity generated by the plugin where I did plug the ID Api Key and project number ,0
725,stackoverflow,I then click on the button but I get this error message ,0
726,stackoverflow,Although the console tells me that there is one instance up and running and the LOCAL ANDROID RUN variable in FILE NAME is set to false ,0
727,stackoverflow,How is that possible and what can I be doing wrong ,0
728,stackoverflow,Thank you a lot in advance ,0
729,stackoverflow,The same number is 2 ,0
730,stackoverflow,Use this logic it will work for consecutive same values otherwise use ArrayList ,0
731,stackoverflow,drl file for creating new rules and modifying rules ,0
732,stackoverflow,What exists for programmatically creating new rules from Java ,0
733,stackoverflow,I don t know if this is the accepted way but with the following code I comine CODE FRAGMENT files with programmatically created rules in Drools 6 ,0
734,stackoverflow,The following comment is found at the Java documentation ,0
735,stackoverflow,Adding API NAME after awaitTermination method call can provide a delay which can get you the output you were looking for ,0
736,stackoverflow,I took help from this Question ,0
737,stackoverflow,System prints data like this ,0
738,stackoverflow,If not I just wanted to know if Java serializes objects that haven t been initialized yet ,0
739,stackoverflow,So basically you write primitives e g CODE FRAGMENT or objects CODE FRAGMENT with the CODE FRAGMENT and then you read them back using the CODE FRAGMENT with the corresponding CODE FRAGMENT methods ,0
740,stackoverflow,You can try use byte instead of String object ,0
741,stackoverflow,Each String object contains set of UTF 16 chars ,0
742,stackoverflow,It means 2 bytes per symbol in most case ,0
743,stackoverflow,UTF 8 encoding uses one byte for ASCII two bytes for many europe languages ,0
744,stackoverflow,Also each String object contains reference to char array ,0
745,stackoverflow,So you can easy reduce count of objects by factor two one byte instead of pair String char and array length of UTF 8 symbols usually less than length of UTF 16 chars ,0
746,stackoverflow,And then in your other file ,0
747,stackoverflow,Assuming that the only issue you re having is the name of the dependent library see CODE FRAGMENT ,0
748,stackoverflow,But this library has a dependency to other native library which cames bundled with the API NAME ,0
749,stackoverflow,In the debug outputs of JNA i can see only the API NAME will extract from FILE NAME package ,0
750,stackoverflow,I have looked to the JNA code of the extraction method ,0
751,stackoverflow,Please see attached cause exception ,0
752,stackoverflow,You don t you get Neo4j cross compiled to the client you have to run Neo4j as part of your backend service ,0
753,stackoverflow,You can look at the readme document on Github repository to get started ,0
754,stackoverflow,Sample code on working with blob can also be found in the repository here ,0
755,stackoverflow,I am using Android Studio ,0
756,stackoverflow,The logcat is as below ,0
757,stackoverflow,Can anyone tell me where I am going wrong ,0
758,stackoverflow,FILE NAME project is called Osmosis and contains 2 packages search and common ,0
759,stackoverflow,My API NAME seems to include the reference ,0
760,stackoverflow,Add CODE FRAGMENT after your other two CODE FRAGMENT lines in your CODE FRAGMENT ,0
761,stackoverflow,As well I am adding a set amount of Labels using an array and a for loop ,0
762,stackoverflow,I have tried using both a VBox and an HBox but I am not able to see a difference in my result ,0
763,stackoverflow,I have also tried to use ,0
764,stackoverflow, In this case I would have used ,0
765,stackoverflow,Quick fix is to make the VBox as the parent of the StackPane ,0
766,stackoverflow,so how we can parse above like example expression easier or FILE NAME api for string parser ,0
767,stackoverflow,This uses ByteBuffer s CODE FRAGMENT method ,0
768,stackoverflow,Now I want this when the user check a shipper by EditTextView I have from database an Object ,0
769,stackoverflow,I want insert the information of this object in the Fragment ,0
770,stackoverflow,Now in the onCreate method I have insert in all tab the FILE NAME but I will to create three FILE NAME for the three tabs ,0
771,stackoverflow,So instead of setting Bundle to null you can do something like this ,0
772,stackoverflow,Check out this link for more info ,0
773,stackoverflow,I did not remove sunpkcs 11 provider after each API NAME call ,0
774,stackoverflow,This exception is not because of absence of SunPkcs11 because i see the SunPkcs11 that i added in the providers list ,0
775,stackoverflow,I m new to FILE NAME language ,0
776,stackoverflow,In Java you typically don t write a single method that handle all sorts of arguments with all sorts of different types ,0
777,stackoverflow,Autoboxing is syntactic sugar ,0
778,stackoverflow,If you want to implement a dynamic binding between names strings and values in Java use a FILE NAME ,0
779,stackoverflow,So just use CODE FRAGMENT instead of CODE FRAGMENT ,0
780,stackoverflow,When I perform CODE FRAGMENT request to CODE FRAGMENT I get following JSON ,0
781,stackoverflow,I am using library CODE FRAGMENT for work with CODE FRAGMENT file s ,0
782,stackoverflow,Then you can do what you want with the Collection sort it loop through it create a Comparator etc ,0
783,stackoverflow,I was thinking of creating a new JSONArray object and copy node which contains Carlos ,0
784,stackoverflow,You ll need to use a regex for for the CODE FRAGMENT path expression ,0
785,stackoverflow,I am doing a small project it is a interoperability FILE NAME and ,0
786,stackoverflow,The program is just a hello world Program ,0
787,stackoverflow,You create a reference type by prefixing FILE NAME declaration with CODE FRAGMENT keyword ,0
788,stackoverflow,CODE FRAGMENT is what you use to create an object in managed heap ,0
789,stackoverflow, Note that nodes may have multiple style classes though I have never understood why this is a CODE FRAGMENT rather than a CODE FRAGMENT ,0
790,stackoverflow,Finally ID Selectors work by specifying an id on the node ,0
791,stackoverflow,So you can do ,0
792,stackoverflow,One last note you mentioned that your line lacked API NAME ,0
793,stackoverflow,The code in Java is ,0
794,stackoverflow,What you need is to assign data to a string read from the stream ,0
795,stackoverflow,This is a question just to satisfy my curiosity ,0
796,stackoverflow,Consider the following two Java regular expressions CODE FRAGMENT and CODE FRAGMENT ,0
797,stackoverflow,Are they equivalent ,0
798,stackoverflow,I went on and assumed you meant to quantify it as greedy hence the CODE FRAGMENT in my example instead of non quantified CODE FRAGMENT in your question ,0
799,stackoverflow,They are equivalent when you use them as is with CODE FRAGMENT ,0
800,stackoverflow,I like working with eclipse better than Android Studio ,0
801,stackoverflow,So I first tried to compile the sweet alert dialog project and I found out that I need to first somehow include the materialish progress ,0
802,stackoverflow,Try to download ,0
803,stackoverflow,May be some resources will need to be copied from archives too ,0
804,stackoverflow,Let me know if there are any other details that might help ,0
805,stackoverflow,Dug this up WEB ADDRESS ,0
806,stackoverflow,Guess I ll be trying to find a creative workaround in the meantime The proximate cause of the failure is that there are more than 5 levels of subdirectories under ,0
807,stackoverflow,Provide path from src or bin to file location Running from eclipse ,0
808,stackoverflow,For more Information WEB ADDRESS ,0
809,stackoverflow,I needed to write a program which adds binary numbers as if they were decimal ,0
810,stackoverflow,If you want to print a int as binary use CODE FRAGMENT to get the string representation of a CODE FRAGMENT in binary ,0
811,stackoverflow,Version of Spring is NUMBER ,0
812,stackoverflow,I have a session bean declared as ,0
813,stackoverflow,After debugging i found out that when test spring context is started in the ,0
814,stackoverflow,You can add a util method to your test something like ,0
815,stackoverflow,In production I would assume that you are configuring either a CODE FRAGMENT or a CODE FRAGMENT ,0
816,stackoverflow,See JIRA issue SPR 13217 for details ,0
817,stackoverflow,However having said that if you have a concrete need for modifying the mock request created by CODE FRAGMENT manually and then having that re used with CODE FRAGMENT you can create the FILE NAME in your project ,0
818,stackoverflow,Obviously the above example re implements CODE FRAGMENT but you can naturally do the same for CODE FRAGMENT etc ,0
819,stackoverflow,Sam author of the Spring TestContext Framework ,0
820,stackoverflow,And DispatherConfig is this ,0
821,stackoverflow,Let s assume that we have a for loop that will loop through a collection or array of Strings ,0
822,stackoverflow,hey here s how I usually achieve that ,0
823,stackoverflow,Let s put your code inside a method ,0
824,stackoverflow,If you use CODE FRAGMENT the loop will terminate and CODE FRAGMENT will be reached ,0
825,stackoverflow,If you know the word can only be found once you can surely place an break statement so the loop won t continue after finding the match ,0
826,stackoverflow,The application is a Spring Hibernate webApp which access the Oracle database ,0
827,stackoverflow,This was configured in an API NAME as follows ,0
828,stackoverflow,Question is of course what is a solution to use the result of Oracle function for the new value of the ID ,0
829,stackoverflow,Edit To call an Oracle function from Java see if this works for you ,0
830,stackoverflow,Call Java Oracle Functions From Java program and see the Java CallableStatement API ,0
831,stackoverflow,When I run this on Windows the console tells me ,0
832,stackoverflow,Does CODE FRAGMENT work ,0
833,stackoverflow,Note however it s called CODE FRAGMENT with a capital D ,0
834,stackoverflow,Question 2 From the javadoc ,0
835,stackoverflow,So yes you need to keep track of the position yourself ,0
836,stackoverflow,But when I run this json through CODE FRAGMENT I see that CODE FRAGMENT been replaced with CODE FRAGMENT ,0
837,stackoverflow,What happens if a thread has been executed same time more than once ,0
838,stackoverflow,Something like below ,0
839,stackoverflow,Hope it clarifies ,0
840,stackoverflow,I have to fetch time stamp from DB and retrieve only time and compare two time ,0
841,stackoverflow,Which outputs ,0
842,stackoverflow,I have a string like this ,0
843,stackoverflow,Now i want to translate the string FILE NAME entity decoder ,0
844,stackoverflow,url WEB ADDRESS ,0
845,stackoverflow,is there FILE NAME api to translate it ,0
846,stackoverflow,I m using it to convert huge lists of strings with HTML entities in them back to normal strings ,0
847,stackoverflow,And I got the output like this ,0
848,stackoverflow,mm stands for minutes ,0
849,stackoverflow,So using It outputs CODE FRAGMENT for me ,0
850,stackoverflow,Accourding to this answer ,0
851,stackoverflow,IS there any way so that I can open using the code itself ,0
852,stackoverflow,and call the client as follows ,0
853,stackoverflow,The API NAME property represents an estimate of the number of words in the Word document ,0
854,stackoverflow,API NAME updates this property when you call API NAME method ,0
855,stackoverflow,Please see the following sample code ,0
856,stackoverflow,en dash em dash word count differs from MS Office ,0
857,stackoverflow,Hi I have a sample log file here ,0
858,stackoverflow,The API NAME String regex ,0
859,stackoverflow,You need to encapsulate the regex pattern in quotes ,0
860,stackoverflow,The line that uses the CODE FRAGMENT method should look something like this ,0
861,stackoverflow,To stop this runnable you have to call this when needed ,0
862,stackoverflow,And a string contains the name of the enum ,0
863,stackoverflow,You have to do it like this ,0
864,stackoverflow,Here s an alternative way ,0
865,stackoverflow,Remember you should use FULLY QUALIFIED CLASSNAME ,0
866,stackoverflow,Here is the actual data sent ,0
867,stackoverflow,I think you also have to look at the database configuration ,0
868,stackoverflow,The package gets deleted in the registry ,0
869,stackoverflow,install4j transforms entered package names to path names so ,0
870,stackoverflow,Using FILE NAME I can do something like this ,0
871,stackoverflow,Any suggestion for a better design would be appreciated ,0

878,stackoverflow,You can also retrieve the item by calling API NAME Test1 and it will return the item associated with Test1 ,0
879,stackoverflow,In App 2 if I call API NAME Test1 will I get a null pointer exception or will I get 1 ,0
880,stackoverflow,I am not sure exactly how static classes in included libraries work scope wise ,0
881,stackoverflow,I am curious about the problem I have proposed ,0
882,stackoverflow,Thank you in advance ,0
883,stackoverflow,That being said the JARs you see there only support JPA not core Hibernate ,0
884,stackoverflow,But i didn t give me the thing i need ,0
885,stackoverflow,How can i do that ,0
886,stackoverflow,Since CODE FRAGMENT is a meta character and it s have a special meaning in regex ,0

889,stackoverflow,I have integrated sonarQube for code analysis ,0
890,stackoverflow,What do I need to change about the way I package my app so it can just use the latest Java ,0
891,stackoverflow,You should use a CODE FRAGMENT for this task ,0
892,stackoverflow,If so then how far does this go for example could a static final field be accessed by one thread before it s been initialized by another ,0
893,stackoverflow,I m trying to compile a tool which uses apache ant on linux ,0
894,stackoverflow,I also have set JAVA HOME ,0
895,stackoverflow,Use full path in ANT HOME eg ,0
896,stackoverflow,It dependes where it is exactly located ,0
897,stackoverflow,Thanks and Greeting ,0
898,stackoverflow,So the question is ,0
899,stackoverflow,If you are using a PaaS like Heroku they usually provide a way to setup environment variables using their interface ,0
900,stackoverflow,This way this variable get configured in every instance you use ,0
901,stackoverflow,try this type code ,0
902,stackoverflow,In the CODE FRAGMENT listener we can determine which button was clicked ,0
903,stackoverflow,and call this at every button saves you the setOnClickListener ,0
904,stackoverflow,If you add a method to do the CODE FRAGMENT and CODE FRAGMENT you can reduce the lines for each button from two to one ,0
905,stackoverflow,If you need to shorten the button code Use View s in OnClick with help of switch statement ,0
906,stackoverflow,Create the number of buttons that you want with different button id ,0
907,stackoverflow,You can use syntax like ,0
908,stackoverflow,I am trying to write missed responses to an external text file ,0
909,stackoverflow,In your code you need to replace ,0

919,stackoverflow,I also tried using this ,0
920,stackoverflow,Wildfly Developer Guide ,0
921,stackoverflow,The code i am using is ,0
922,stackoverflow,Assume you have this directory layout ,0
923,stackoverflow,What s happening ,0
924,stackoverflow,I ve also verified previous GC logs and found that this issue was not forever ,0
925,stackoverflow,It started about a month ago after a deployment ,0
926,stackoverflow,CODE FRAGMENT informs Java VM when CMS should be triggered ,0
927,stackoverflow,As part of GC first minor GC is triggered ,0
928,stackoverflow,I have found one more related SE question CMS garbage collector when does it run ,0
929,stackoverflow,So there are a few possible causes to your woes and I ll state the likely quick fix first and then state some best practices below that you should consider doing in the long term ,0
930,stackoverflow,You should be able to do this by adding the parameter CODE FRAGMENT ,0
931,stackoverflow,Also based on what I can see from Stas blog entry on the subject the unit is milliseconds not seconds ,0
932,stackoverflow,Try these longer term things in the long term ,0
933,stackoverflow,If you can try the G1GC collector ,0
934,stackoverflow,You are using Java 7 so if you can in your current environment give it a try ,0
935,stackoverflow,It s meant for performance with big heaps ,0
936,stackoverflow,Remember the bigger the heap the longer the garbage collector takes irrespective of whether you are using a concurrent collector such as CMS ,0
937,stackoverflow,You have a lot of tuning parameters and I would challenge that you need the majority of them ,0
938,stackoverflow,Here is the FILE NAME implementation ,0
939,stackoverflow,At first we need to check that type is actually inherits from CODE FRAGMENT ,0
940,stackoverflow,You can achieve everything Vadim Martynov s answer does with an additional type parameter and additional type constraints and still receive compile time verification ,0
941,stackoverflow,One way would be ,0
942,stackoverflow,FILE NAME does one thing and does it well ,0
943,stackoverflow, If you re not using Java 8 it s easy enough to write a CODE FRAGMENT which takes an existing one and a CODE FRAGMENT which takes two existing ones ,0
944,stackoverflow,You can also use Java 8 s static methods in CODE FRAGMENT ,0
945,stackoverflow,Thanks alot ,0
946,stackoverflow,So if i changed the 1st comparator to sort by name not price the 2nd will changed as well but not the opposite ,0

963,stackoverflow,Any suggestions or interesting links appreciated ,0
964,stackoverflow,And all injections occurs just once on application starting ,0
965,stackoverflow,Let s find out how scoped beans do work ,0
966,stackoverflow,Now about scoped proxies ,0
967,stackoverflow,This means that every time you will operate on the exact same object that was originally injected on start ,0
968,stackoverflow,To do it as said in documentation declare you bean as proxified ,0
969,stackoverflow,CODE FRAGMENT working almost same way ,0
970,stackoverflow,The text file has 10 lines of data and each line contains a piece of data in the format of Integer1 String1 String2 example 123 ABC DEFG ,0

979,stackoverflow,To get the terms we parse the TermsVectorResponse as follows ,0
980,stackoverflow,Why not ,0
981,stackoverflow,What you probably want is CODE FRAGMENT which returns CODE FRAGMENT if the cursor is not at the beginning of the result set OR if the result set is empty ,0
982,stackoverflow,It isn t not at least at JPA level ,0
983,stackoverflow,This triggers a CODE FRAGMENT on other tables entities ,0
984,stackoverflow, note CODE FRAGMENT is my JPA implementation ,0
985,stackoverflow,Currently I have a method ,0
986,stackoverflow,The reason I do not want to have method to accept Reader is that I want my own method to have own control to decide what type of encoding should be used ,0
987,stackoverflow,CODE FRAGMENT is just going to close the stream via a CODE FRAGMENT in fact at least in the JDK 6 implementation ,0
988,stackoverflow,There s basically nothing to clean up apart from the input stream and structures in memory the GC will take care of the memory so you re done ,0
989,stackoverflow,All of that can just go ,0
990,stackoverflow,I have set up the Interface as follows ,0

1264,stackoverflow,I found that I needed to adjust the Apache configuration to include a ServerName or ServerAlias for the host ,0
1265,stackoverflow,Was being sent from the server to the client ,0
1266,stackoverflow,If you can change the code it helps to use CODE FRAGMENT with no host parameter or with a connected socket ,0

1298,stackoverflow,Power tip Stop thinking in any particular time zone ,0
1299,stackoverflow,Think of UTC as the One True Time ,0
1300,stackoverflow,We apply a time zone only to report a particular region s wall clock time to the user ,0
1301,stackoverflow,The FILE NAME represents a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds ,0
1302,stackoverflow,Think of an CODE FRAGMENT as a CODE FRAGMENT stripped of it assigned time zone ,0
1303,stackoverflow,We can extract an CODE FRAGMENT from each of our pair of CODE FRAGMENT objects ,0
1304,stackoverflow,The Joda Time project now in maintenance mode advises migration API NAME ,0
1305,stackoverflow,Does anyone know the thinking behind removing this option ,0
1306,stackoverflow,With CODE FRAGMENT this example took NUMBER seconds with the option on and NUMBER second with it off in Java 6 update 29 ,0

1330,stackoverflow,What is a CODE FRAGMENT and what is a CODE FRAGMENT ,0
1331,stackoverflow,Jar file check following link ,0
1332,stackoverflow,Hope it will help you ,0
1333,stackoverflow,So what do you think ,0
1334,stackoverflow,Its CODE FRAGMENT method performs the CODE FRAGMENT CODE FRAGMENT test described in the assignment ,0
1335,stackoverflow,Your CODE FRAGMENT method will pass a CODE FRAGMENT directly to CODE FRAGMENT ,0
1336,stackoverflow,Call it CODE FRAGMENT or the like ,0
1337,stackoverflow,It accepts a regular CODE FRAGMENT object in its constructor and simply delegates all methods other than CODE FRAGMENT to the wrapped object ,0
1338,stackoverflow,Since this is homework here s some hints ,0
1339,stackoverflow,To clarify a CODE FRAGMENT object has a method called CODE FRAGMENT with the following signature ,0
1340,stackoverflow,Let s look at a sample call ,0
1341,stackoverflow,You can still compare numerically which was the goal all along ,0
1342,stackoverflow,and finally here is the FILE NAME ,0
1343,stackoverflow,Assuming instance variables frst way EC CC PT are ZERO ,0
1344,stackoverflow,CODE FRAGMENT gets the value 1 ,0
1345,stackoverflow,No it s not the same ,0
1346,stackoverflow,only HC will be initialized ,0
1347,stackoverflow,all variables will be initialized with value 1 ,0
1348,stackoverflow,You can also do it as follows ,0
1349,stackoverflow,First declare all variables ,0
1350,stackoverflow,Then assign value ,0

1355,stackoverflow,Is this api up to date ,0
1356,stackoverflow,Furthermore is there any other better api ,0
1357,stackoverflow,Here is the code that i am using to post a comment ,0
1358,stackoverflow,I know the message is posted because i can access it using WEB ADDRESS Now my new question is ,0
1359,stackoverflow,Is this the correct way to display posts on the app page ,0
1360,stackoverflow, NAME ,0
1361,stackoverflow,I tried something like this ,0
1362,stackoverflow,The result was byte ,0
1363,stackoverflow,You can use CODE FRAGMENT to create a CODE FRAGMENT from JPEG data ,0
1364,stackoverflow,As an alternative to marking progress in the CODE FRAGMENT itself consider decorating it with a CODE FRAGMENT or a variation ,0
1365,stackoverflow,Note that the GUI s CODE FRAGMENT can update arbitrary components and the progress bar can be customized ,0
1366,stackoverflow,Say after several text appended to a text area I want this to be appended ,0
1367,stackoverflow, Please wait a download is in progress ,0
1368,stackoverflow,After that a download progress status with progress meter character gets appended ,0
1369,stackoverflow,Hope that helps some of you with the same problem ,1
1370,stackoverflow,I would recommend that you check the documentation for what they do ,1
1371,stackoverflow,When I print the path of the resource using API NAME resource API NAME it gives the path correctly as ,1
1372,stackoverflow,Which we currently are saved from using CODE FRAGMENT ,1
1373,stackoverflow,Currently I can t see any performance degradation for 5 10k elements and 2 nodes ,1
1374,stackoverflow,It even works on Android ,1
1375,stackoverflow,CODE FRAGMENT is designed for increased read efficiency since this is the primary use of the API ,1
1376,stackoverflow,And you re able to use an external configuration file no extender needed to configure your logging ,1
1377,stackoverflow,Enabled and pointed my client to a secure port on my container and the last example the one that causes the exception works successfully ,1
1378,stackoverflow,It s a good structure for safe publishing of data among threads ,1
1379,stackoverflow,Besides increasing your heap most of the time it also helps to increase your PermGen space by using the CODE FRAGMENT paramater ,1
1380,stackoverflow,You include your if switch in a Factory which takes care of the ugliness and hides the abundance of ifs ,1
1381,stackoverflow,APKInspector provides both analysis functions and graphic features for the users to gain deep insight into the malicious apps ,1
1382,stackoverflow,Problem solved ,1
1383,stackoverflow,I suspect it may be more efficient to both query and write your records within each CODE FRAGMENT but this is an assumption that would likely require testing ,1
1384,stackoverflow,It will do the correct legal stuff ,1
1385,stackoverflow,There is a slight improvement that you can do that uses the CODE FRAGMENT s internal cache by using its CODE FRAGMENT method ,1
1386,stackoverflow,But in the main case it works good enough ,1
1387,stackoverflow,Stable and production ready lib ,1
1388,stackoverflow,Not an extremely expensive operation I think ,1
1389,stackoverflow,because it provides the lot of flexibility and improvements over using normal arrays ,1
1390,stackoverflow,This provides the method CODE FRAGMENT for inserting the element at specific location and it is very efficient ,1
1391,stackoverflow,Whatever you are talking about is best done by the CODE FRAGMENT WEB ADDRESS ,1
1392,stackoverflow,This will preserve the insertion order and insure no duplicates ,1
1393,stackoverflow,They both seem to print out the list fine ,1
1394,stackoverflow,Well a solution that works for me ,1
1395,stackoverflow,Finally an IDE would be helpful for you ,1
1396,stackoverflow,John Spurlock the create of OData4j personally responds to almost all of the posts there ,1
1397,stackoverflow,As for iOS development with OData the best out there is OData4ObjC ,1
1398,stackoverflow,CODE FRAGMENT overrides these methods so there is no fear that such an Exception will be thrown ,1
1399,stackoverflow,It s ok ,1
1400,stackoverflow,Here s a set of solutions to this challenge for both JDK types and Eclipse Collections types using CODE FRAGMENT ,1
1401,stackoverflow,Any of the 5 options listed there should work just fine though ,1
1402,stackoverflow,I can assure you it works from within a web app and also within an application using the Spring framework ,1
1403,stackoverflow,take a look FILE NAME executors as these will help with your scheduling and remove the need for the sleep ,1
1404,stackoverflow,Useful links ,1
1405,stackoverflow,Worked ,1
1406,stackoverflow,Javolution Structs supports mapping of off heap memory as a data structure ,1
1407,stackoverflow,or more concisely ,1
1408,stackoverflow,I suggest you to use ,1
1409,stackoverflow,Follow the steps otherwise your code is fine ,1
1410,stackoverflow,This works for me ,1
1411,stackoverflow,For me this worked ,1
1412,stackoverflow,Specifically for bower there looks to be a good maven plugin here ,1
1413,stackoverflow,It does its job but was built for our use case ,1
1414,stackoverflow,That way you don t need to worry about API NAME ,1
1415,stackoverflow,I wouldn t worry too much about memory consumption unless you either have an insane number of tracks or several different maps floating around ,1
1416,stackoverflow,I m not too certain that the CODE FRAGMENT solution is the best solution but I think far from the worst and should be pretty good on its own ,1
1417,stackoverflow,So this works ,1
1418,stackoverflow,In lieu of that however in my experience ASM offers probably the best combination of maturity flexibility and ease of use ,1
1419,stackoverflow,As others have already said JFormattedTextField is the best way to do this ,1
1420,stackoverflow,There is CODE FRAGMENT to convert XML to JSON and mongo can deal with this on it s own ,1
1421,stackoverflow,Curiously you are doing it right for the CODE FRAGMENT property ,1
1422,stackoverflow,Solved in case anyone stumbles upon similar problem ,1
1423,stackoverflow,Of course it will works fine if only you know how many tasks you have ,1
1424,stackoverflow,This solution is more flexible ,1
1425,stackoverflow,but if you want you can do this ,1
1426,stackoverflow,I have FILE NAME that allows to download a file from the internet ,1
1427,stackoverflow,With use of API NAME all does work perfect ,1
1428,stackoverflow,There are many ways to solve it the simplest is call ,1
1429,stackoverflow,The FILE NAME file will compile without and trouble ,1
1430,stackoverflow,You can use Gson library or any other to parse the json object FILE NAME object ,1
1431,stackoverflow,Here s the official API on Java CODE FRAGMENT useful for quantifier syntax ,1
1432,stackoverflow,The format CODE FRAGMENT can be used to convert any string of digits to the base CODE FRAGMENT ,1
1433,stackoverflow,In any case manually adding an instance of CODE FRAGMENT to the front of the filter chain in your test will solve the problem ,1
1434,stackoverflow,The good news CODE FRAGMENT is true ,1
1435,stackoverflow,The simplest solution would be to use Java 8 s Date Time API ,1
1436,stackoverflow,It seems after a quick google search that a popular solution to this is using CODE FRAGMENT ,1
1437,stackoverflow,This might prove to be useful unbescape ,1
1438,stackoverflow,Since all but the day of month in the line prefix is a fixed length the simplest solution is ,1
1439,stackoverflow,There is a good example showing how to put a file onto WebDAV server ,1
1440,stackoverflow,Note There were no errors in the console and the CODE FRAGMENT function was working perfectly ,1
1441,stackoverflow,That way you often don t need to implement CODE FRAGMENT at all manually ,1
1442,stackoverflow,And running your CODE FRAGMENT will succeed ,1
1443,stackoverflow,Ok I finally figured out what I was looking for this link was also quite helpful ,1
1444,stackoverflow,Earlier I was writing the file to local machine then it was working fine ,1
1445,stackoverflow,That s correct behavior ,1
1446,stackoverflow,I finally managed to get it to work ,1
1447,stackoverflow,Thank you dunni for your help you ve put me on the right path ,1
1448,stackoverflow,And it works like a charm now SMILE FACE ,1
1449,stackoverflow,but you can use the very util FILE NAME like ,1
1450,stackoverflow,Java doesn t have in built method on array to do slice but there are classes which can help you with it ,1
1451,stackoverflow,FILE NAME under test uses FILE NAME that has a simple autowired configuration bean ,1
1452,stackoverflow,This answer describes what is happening more clearly ,1
1453,stackoverflow,For example the following works great ,1
1454,stackoverflow,It is able to handle all polygon cases including the self intersecting ones ,1
1455,stackoverflow,Comparison time should be fast so total run time should be only slightly more than sum of run time for each ordered query ,1
1456,stackoverflow,Congratulations ,1
1457,stackoverflow,Databases are much better at handling data than Java ,1
1458,stackoverflow,Java is a fine general programming language but databases are optimized for relational data processing they just do it faster with less CPU less memory and less network traffic ,1
1459,stackoverflow,Embrace the Joy of Sets ,1
1460,stackoverflow,I understand the boolean expression here ,1
1461,stackoverflow,If you are looking for a way to write to streams in a more intuitive way try CODE FRAGMENT ,1
1462,stackoverflow,This is not particularly unusual or wrong ,1
1463,stackoverflow,Here s a knocked up utility to prove the point ,1
1464,stackoverflow,it s worth a shot ,1
1465,stackoverflow,I heard like Java is the most suitable platform to develop that ,1
1466,stackoverflow,It s really good ,1
1467,stackoverflow,It s an excellent fast library ,1
1468,stackoverflow,At least I can commit a project on OSX and update to Windows and it still works ,1
1469,stackoverflow,check API NAME it s the fastest way to copy part of an array FILE NAME ,1
1470,stackoverflow,This works fine ,1
1471,stackoverflow,It ll be available in JSF by CODE FRAGMENT ,1
1472,stackoverflow,The following code therefore might be as I have not attempted using it a better one if you are willing to use Mojarra specific classes ,1
1473,stackoverflow,Better to use FILE NAME API there are several I am not sure which one is better it s more straightforward solution ,1
1474,stackoverflow,But this gets optimized by the JIT and there is no measurable impact in production ,1
1475,stackoverflow,I still think it s not the best design but I did quite a bit of testing and can say with a good bit of confidence that it had no real impact on performance ,1
1476,stackoverflow,Or since in NUMBER of cases day will be correct ,1
1477,stackoverflow,The set can be a CODE FRAGMENT and you can wrap in an unmodifiable for good measure ,1
1478,stackoverflow,Even in your own parsing approach you can make it faster by returning the enum when you parse the list ,1
1479,stackoverflow,This should almost be obvious ,1
1480,stackoverflow,The application is complete and working fine ,1
1481,stackoverflow,And this code worked ,1
1482,stackoverflow,Working Configuration ,1
1483,stackoverflow,There is a solution to your problem ,1
1484,stackoverflow,This configuration works very well ,1
1485,stackoverflow, Hopefully with a good example ,1
1486,stackoverflow,The maintainers rationale is covered in the JSF specification ,1
1487,stackoverflow,Also JodaTime makes calculations with time much simpler ,1
1488,stackoverflow,The option reduces heap usage ,1
1489,stackoverflow,For workloads that are memory capacity constrained i e have to run with limited heap space and GC takes a lot of time this option can prove useful ,1
1490,stackoverflow,CharSequences can also be a lot more efficient to manipulate subsequences can be defined as views pointers onto the original content for example instead of copying ,1
1491,stackoverflow,With the new design they could also support other encodings in future ,1
1492,stackoverflow,API NAME can be used ,1
1493,stackoverflow,Here s a good example from Jetty s wiki page WEB ADDRESS ,1
1494,stackoverflow,Using consistent indentation and sensible whitespace can make your code much easier to read ,1
1495,stackoverflow,Very good example of steady pooling readHere ,1
1496,stackoverflow,Now we re getting to the good part ,1
1497,stackoverflow,So far i ve done this for Twitter and it works very well ,1
1498,stackoverflow,I solved the earlier problem ,1
1499,stackoverflow,Addendum CODE FRAGMENT is useful for managing lengthy background tasks while displaying interim progress ,1

1650,appreviews,average no doubt the art work of the game is original and fits the environment well but that alone does not make a good title the gameplay is interesting but lacks a real reason to come back or be played over another game the split screen in the only feature that stood out but even then it got boring quickly i liked the game thought it was promising but a lack of ideas to keep me playing made the experience fall short ,-1

1750,appreviews,simply the best i very rarely write reviews even more rare is when i like an app enough to buy it this app deserves both i have seriously tried most music players for the android and this one has everything i need audio engine is tops start and stop via headphone jack great album art download lots of other programs have these things but either lack in these or other features i especially like the simple issue of bass and treble control price a little high that was the only thing holding me back from buying it sooner was thinking of giving it 4 stars because of price but what the heck i gave it five ,1

1764,appreviews,ausome this game is really a good game but very advertisements are there,1
1765,appreviews,excellent you can change your car s it s easy to park it self,1
1766,appreviews, fun and trouble free,1
1767,appreviews,excellent app but add more this is much better than samsung s equation detection but the only thing missing in this app is the lack of variety just like in the note 10 1 please add more equations and have the ability to solve complex algebra i ll be glad to pay for such a feature makes work so much easier ,1
1768,appreviews,suggestions comprehensive an incredibly solid start there are some quirks and bugs that aren t suuuper major and an overall lack of features but the base here is startlingly fresh and good the lack of gesture support and more icon customization as well as a way to hide the settings page tucking it away in a gesture overflow menu somewhere or separate app shortcut make it difficult to leave nova launcher here are my suggestions and what it would take to make me switch customize app icons on long press individually applying a theme is great but they rarely cover 100 of all apps and the inconsistency drives me mad gesture support i love being able to swipe down anywhere and pulling down my notification shade or swiping up for my app drawer etc customization of panels i d like to be able to decide if i want a full apps list or the launcher settings and be able to decide where they are located i have already purchased the pro key so i m excited to see if these features get implemented i currently run a custom setup i made for myself in nova launcher mimicking the google now aesthetic but having it in launcher form would be 10x better good luck ,0
1769,appreviews,gets the job done i was a handyshopper user and although i miss being able to record aisles and prices for many stores for one item i love that i can add something to the shopping list with my phone and my husband can see it immediately on his phone i also like that out of milk has a web site where i can build a list so when i m planning meals for the week i can be building the list too using a regular keyboard i see the value of the pantry option i ll probably be using it to keep an inventory of our freeer and our spices i would like to see a way to add items to more than one list for example i d like chips to be on the costco list and the snack list so if i m shopping at one store and see a great price i d know i needed chips overall thisi app gets the job done and it s popularity makes me think the features i want may be added some day ,0
1770,appreviews,just great excellent i wish it had the black list feature,1
1771,appreviews,great apps works well and looks great lots of available providers from the 5 or so apps i ve tested deliveries seems to support the most i submitted a bug report when statuses from one of the providers wasn t working as expected the developer promptly got back to me and fixed the issue only feature i would like is auto detection of provider based on the tracking number but as a fellow programmer i understand the challenges presented by such a feature so this doesn t affect my rating ,1
1772,appreviews, easy to use and simple but miss some features like changing color or font for multiple nodes,0
1773,appreviews,blech horrible lack of features and customization good for only occasional typing i guess ,-1
1774,appreviews,excellent app no complaints at all but still waiting for urdu localization,1
1775,appreviews,offline browsing please allow us to open local html or swf files there are few browsers out there that can not play local html but those lack the browsing playing features of this app ,0
1776,appreviews,airplane mode i know you can t do anything about it but the lack of airplane mode scheduling in kitkat just sucks other features are very useful ,-1
1777,appreviews,flash i don t have flash and i don t know how to get it,-1
1778,appreviews,excellent app for galaxy s4 the major lack to me on my gs4 is that the home screen will not rotate to landscape mode this app resolves the problem i have a feature request the app has to be manually started each time the phone restarts then the setting has to be selected then the close button selected an autostart option with a selectable default mode would make this the ideal app ,1
1779,appreviews,a beautiful and efficient app with one glaringly annoying flaw this is what got me to a smartphone in the first place and it remains the best of the best i miss the labs features but i like the current incarnation thanks for putting the scale bar back in but why does it disappear a map especially one that zooms and pans needs a scale bar keep it visible and i can give you back that 5th star ,0
1780,appreviews,please just bring back the old maps how do you update a software and take away all the good features while not adding any new ones i miss so many things the button that shows my entire route in nav the option for other routes the option to search while in nav for things in my route the option to just view the map while nav is still running separately i use the gps a lot for work and this update is killing me i need old version of maps please,-1
1781,appreviews,an excellent offline rss reader on my nexus 7 a solid simple lightweight reader the only feature i miss compared with my desktop reader is the ability to group feeds in folders thanks are due to the author this is an open source program and there are similar apps based on it if you have one of these installed as i had uninstall it first or you get a duplicate error this is not a web based reader like google reader but you can import your feeds as an opml file ,1
1782,appreviews,nice but it is nice but when it log we cannot take picture,0
1783,appreviews,should add more filters filters are a little lame and don t suit my pictures if you add more filters i ll rate it 5 stars lt 3 and you should add more fonts and unique features unlike other editing apps ,-1
1784,appreviews,good application best news application it should add a feature of notification also ,1
1785,appreviews,far from as cool as smartglass i went with a ps4 rather than the xbox one but i do miss smart glass they need to make this app enable the voice features and things like the store should be built in not a browser link ,-1
1786,appreviews,excellent really great app much better than other bus apps the data is sometimes poor but this is not the app s fault looses 1 star as it occasionally force closes on launch but isn t really a problem as it auto reloads feature requests buses moving along the google maps in real time colour in times that i can easily walk to from current gps in green ones i have to run to in orange and ones i ll miss in red ,1
1787,appreviews,one thing missing i really like this app simple user interface and works smoothly espn should add a feature to notify you when your current selection is finished that is the only thing missing ,1
1788,appreviews,good but lacking all in all the app works but its pretty lack luster it does a few things well and a few ok like the feed friends list and adding messaging and connecting to your ps4 for second display features but it stops there the store takes you a external browser the second screen features are limited and the keyboard is a bit buggy and only works 70 of the time its slow and the positioning of things is not efficient the ui isn t all that intuitive with its lack of gestures and easily accessible features ,-1
1789,appreviews,good good app could do with more size customisations for the widget ,1
1790,appreviews,awesome great game but in the next update y all should add a bet with cash feature,1
1791,appreviews,only 4 stars i love this app i am able to save all of my pdf and epub documents i only have it 4 stars because when in night mode is it very sensitive and if touched wrong the entire screen will turn the lettering black and i have to re install the app please work on brightness feature ,1
1792,appreviews,lack some features please provide option for marking notifications as read or unread also option for commenting on post using picture,-1
1793,appreviews,lack of important functions 1 you can not select multiple images to send at once in this same application 2 you can not send photos to friends they didn t move to telegram yet 3 no option for copying a fragment of a message 4 no automatic sending of any media if the connection is established again you have to do it manually not to mention that these features are available in whatsapp implement these and you will be a serious challenger and gain 5 stars ,-1
1794,appreviews,great app but not perfect if i were reviewing comixology the service i d give it five stars however this is for the android app and for that i can only give it three i d used the ipad app with it s great hd support which is lacking on some android tablets that s not a major issue but the biggest drawback to the app is the lack of sd support a majority of tablets have the option for sd cards expanding their storage space and many apps can take advantage of it it s a shame comixology s app hasn t been able to do this yet i don t know if it s concerns over security if someone could take the books on the card and copy them elsewhere but seriously it s easy enough to copy files from system memory if you look it up give users the option to save to sd cards and this review will jump to five stars ,0
1795,appreviews,okay but lack some features some features i would love to see is the ability to log in and being able to see the ratings and comments on memes kinda like the ios version,-1
1796,appreviews,excellent calculator this is an excellent floating calculator in spite of some minor shortcomings it has all the features that one would want in a small calculator that can be used while one is using other apps the lack of memory functions is easily overcome with the use of parentheses and with these the copy function is more than adequate for most purposes one useful feature which it does not have at the moment is the ability to paste insert data copied from say a text file this would make it possible to use earier results stored in a text file nevertheless this is an excellent app and the developer should be congratulated for a job well done and for generously making it available a no cost ,1
1797,appreviews,improving rapidly this app used to be crappy while the service was ok but recently the app has started receiving updates on a regular basis adding a lot of basic functionality that should have been there from the beginning now it features landscape support resume from last position notification bar controls and save to sd card however i still sorely miss a decent widget easily sortable queues or the extensions found in the desktop app ,1
1798,appreviews,features and new color theme awful i really hate the new android color or lack thereof the blue was fine and i m pretty upset you guys got rid of it bring back the blue and the punctuation on long pressing the period and why is the keyboard shrinking when i switch to symbols ,-1
1799,appreviews,very good but can you add download all attachment as zip option we miss this very nice feature which is available in web version ,1
1800,appreviews,great customization but old and outdated the keyboard has excellent customization but it lack a feature to learn new words automatically and the ui are old,1
1801,appreviews,great app i love this app it s great to have my book lists with me wherever i go and i can easily keep track of which books i ve read to each of my kids one thing missing is the browse feature like the apple version has i miss that add that and i will rate 5 stars ,1
1802,appreviews,very easy and fun not many programs deserve a 5 star but this is one of them i do miss some features or maybe i just don t know how to use the app like continue reading from my last page ad it sometimes reloads from start with me articles but overall this is a very good app thanks guys ,1
1803,appreviews,too slow app is slower than mobile site and or competing livejournal apps like eljay search the marketplace for it what with the lack of features even in the main pc site it s proof that livejournal is no match for even the much maligned facebook rip livejournal ,-1
1804,appreviews,what if you added a feature to estimate your calories when i miss a day always horrible the app assumes i ate nothing that day and my weekly nutrition does not include that day the ability to assume an average of calories based on previous days would be incredibly helpful ,0
1805,appreviews,great launcher what a nice launcher should add locker feature,1
1806,appreviews,cant read japanese if ur not japanese u can read it put it in english so we can understand it ,-1
1807,appreviews,need to add a feature you guys should add a custom car builder feature where you can just build your own car but every part you buy will just keep adding up your total overall great app its fun and it kills time,1
1808,appreviews,x works but wish it could send pictures and text its too simple they should add features to be like voxer ,-1
1809,appreviews,beautiful widget only problem i think is inspite of turning gps off the app is continuously using it as shown by my battery usage statistics ,-1
1810,appreviews,excellent everything is awesome but so far i have found that whenever i turn on wifi my battery drains after using this software may it happens due to widgets or panel but if i turn off it doesn t happen ,1
1811,appreviews,poor bakvas interface and very very slow app ,-1
1812,appreviews,this app is a waste of time i can log in but it always freezes and eventually crashes i do not feel confident with the security on this app if wf can leave us hanging with a horrible app for such a big bank uninstalled htc one,-1
1813,appreviews,bugs in latest update great app until last update that drain battery and continue to use huge amount of data at the background ,-1
1814,appreviews,app is slow it it not well organized the categories like shooters there is only one witch is incorrect and its slow it freezes scrolling is glitchy etc ,-1
1815,appreviews,amazing awesome app for mathematics worth thousand starts thanks devs though the ui is hard to understand thanks for the small size,1
1816,appreviews,battery emptied my battery for 50 in 1 hour while phone was in standby don t know how but had to remove in immediately sorry ,-1
1817,appreviews,good app great launcher i really like it but it is killing my battery ,0
1818,appreviews,great alarm but has new bug making it use lots of battery i like this alarm i definitely like being able to wake up to a random playlist but since an update its now using massive amounts of battery using the gps i m guessing it s something to do with sunrise feature i don t use the sunrise alarm and i certainly don t move between countries enough for it to constantly be updating so either a setting to not allow access to gps or to only update once a day would be useful otherwise i ll have to go back to the standard alarm until it s fixed ,0
1819,appreviews,addictive freezes sometimes annoying having to wait for the lives to recharge,-1
1820,appreviews,i love it but i would love to make this my default sms app i m an old textra and chomp user only gripe is need a lot of improvement like bubble chats even u don t make it bubble it s ok just have a bit of space bet messages cause it is confusing and cluttered to look at then also led notification that s one thing that keeps me from using this as a daily driver we need better notifications this app is worth 5 stars i d even buy it if it had a price just to have it full featured and also text counts on icon,1
1821,appreviews,very fun worth the memory d,1
1822,appreviews, horrible on moment my battery dies faster ,-1
1823,appreviews, eats battery life like the cookie monster eats cookies has the most features of any other system app slows the system to a crawl unistalled ,-1
1824,appreviews,excellent app but drains battery this app works really well and does exactly what s it says it does the only problem i had was that it drained my battery a lot cause it is constantly running ,0
1825,appreviews,there is room for improvement the good thing it lets you know when your moga pro has been connected to your android device and it displays current games that support the controller the bad thing a its interface it s boring even my 14yr old cousin can make it look like tegra zone based stylish themed or better b the bluetooth connection when i m using the game the controller loses the connection with it for too long so i have to press the moga button and try to reconnect or it happens for a few seconds and while i m using the controller my notification keeps showing the controller has been connected to my tablet c the moga pivot connects the controller to the android device but why on earth does it not display the controller battery life how much longer can my controller s built in battery last it should let me know d just let me know whenever a new game has support for the controller i m talking about pivot running in the background self updating its catalog and pushing a notification warning me a new game has entered the supported games list it d be great e sometimes the controller takes too long to connect what s with the hold up please fix these issues they are worth a new update ,0
1826,appreviews,great game its an amazing game but 4 1 ie impossible i know how to do it but there is such a small chance of doing it and for 3 7 you flick the battery to the plain box and the on the left side do the colours it said on the right and you do it for the otherside everytime you get it right you should hear a ding of some sort keep doing that untill the play button comes up toget 3 stars,1
1827,appreviews,good and bad it has virus ,-1
1828,appreviews,great app major glitch the update was nice but it prevents my phone from going to sleep even when the app isn t open uninstalling the app fixed it but i miss it this app alone cut my battery life by more than 20 ,-1
1829,appreviews,good app it s customizable which i like sometimes it s a bit difficult getting items to line up properly and the areas for each part of the display don t change size dynamically so the font sizes will get bigger or smaller to fit in the space alloted for them which i don t like overall it s a good app though ,1
1830,appreviews,battery issues the app will usually consume 20 25 of my battery constantly having to force stop ,-1
1831,appreviews, cute but eats up alot of battery ,-1
1832,appreviews,needs work there should be a way to adjust the shape and location of the eyes cheeks and lips everyone s features are not shaped the same even with a well lit picture taken at the right angle your app proves inaccurate which is highly disappointing seeing as you are a big name cosmetic brand and not some rinky dink developer making a cheap advertising heavy app for little girls i expected more from mary kay and this type of one size fits all lack of attention to detail and diversity makes you look bad ,-1
1833,appreviews,ads great app but the ads come up all the time and it ruins it,-1
1834,appreviews,amazing well designed but confusing says i have a lot more free space than android reports ,1
1835,appreviews,if only i m using this app on a note 10 1 and have also tried the obvious competition there are some features i really like and already miss in other apps especially the very well implemented blending and the in depth controls for setting pressure sensitivity the deal breaker for me at the moment noticeably worse brush lag than in other apps note there is actually a note mode which limits the area to the current tile and is much smoother but offers only a small selection of tools while active i d love to have that kind of performance with the full functionality within reason when it comes to more demanding bigger brushes short version love nearly everything about it and will definitely buy the full version when the performance gets improved ,1
1836,appreviews,regret buying this app fcs so randomly that it s almost impossible to use it for longer period of time lack of updates have made it even more impossible to use haven t seen even a single much requested feature by the community being implemented in this app despite being ok play store for more or less 4 months now disappointed ,-1
1837,appreviews, fails to download phone has sufficient memory and specs ,-1
1838,appreviews,slow no point the viewfinder display is really laggy and slow doesn t seem to offer any creative black and white features so how does it improve over just desaturating color photos ,-1
1839,appreviews, convenient but very unfriendly to the battery,-1
1840,appreviews,pages don t fill the screen well with the latest update i m now able to sign into the app on my galaxy s4 and it s considerably more stable and responsive on my nook hd but unfortunately now when i try to read comics the pages only take up about 2 3 of the screen s available real estate with black borders on the left right and bottom even if i pinch zoom to fill the screen when i move to the next page it goes back to the original size hopefully they can address that issue and then start adding some of the other standard features of comic readers update 8 26 13 today s update still doesn t resolve the issue with comics rendering in about 2 3 of the screen while i m happy to see that they ve doubled the number of issues you can have offline the first time i tried to open one the app crashed back to the launcher all in all this app is still completely unusable on android imo ,-1
1841,jira,guys this is so stupid ,-1
1842,jira,I lost the whole morning cause HBase s RegionServer was dying with no logs no nothing how Am I supposed to debug the issue if u do not even generate a core dump ,-1
1843,jira, quote You are messing down deep below hbase in dfs ,-1
1844,jira,And I think if we re going to do a sweep up of shit we should just kill root ,-1
1845,jira, idiot Yeah I was on that idiot path for a good while but commons lang is a hairball at least where this hashcode making and equals is concerned ,-1
1846,jira,Pull it back in if you think different ,-1
1847,jira,i suck ,-1
1848,jira,Will still be stuck in the loop though if can t actually close regions ,-1
1849,jira,Original edited patch was messed up stupid sed ,-1
1850,jira,Who made this stupid rule ,-1
1851,jira,Sorry but this is just stupid ,-1
1852,jira,But I will quit committing to Hama then because I m not going to support ONLY a binary format ,-1
1853,jira,This is not what I build a framework for ,-1
1854,jira,Well damn ,-1
1855,jira,Blooper after blooper I hate SVN ,-1
1856,jira,This looks reasonable to me sucks we have to special case handling of ,-1
1857,jira,You may want to carefully examine your assumption about this ,-1
1858,jira,Ok wow welcome to Linux hell ,-1
1859,jira,If I get a chance I may even roll it into our dev environment but I am currently in the middle of mem leak hell ,-1
1860,jira,Both equally bad ,-1
1861,jira,Negative I am against fetch groups in principle ,-1
1862,jira,This way lies metadata hell ,-1
1863,jira,Shit there is an dependency Please go to Preferences LDAP Entry Editor and enable the option Show operational attributes ,-1
1864,jira,Damn ,-1
1865,jira,Damn ,-1
1866,jira,Damn ,-1
1867,jira,The evil NPE strik back ,-1
1868,jira,Bloody hell ,-1
1869,jira,Damn time has flown ,-1
1870,jira,Damn it ,-1
1871,jira,This was a very bad bug introduced by me being an idiot ,-1
1872,jira,I have stupidly deleted the original test dir but judging from the suite s output files no output was created after 3 1 2 hours ,-1
1873,jira,damn this was assigned to you since months ,-1
1874,jira,Imo all this just doesn t make sense from a pure performance aspect ,-1
1875,jira,Inserting timestamps automagically would be bad because it would limit a whole swath of use cases ,-1
1876,jira,If they do then Suse s cpio works for old ascii but the c switch is broken ,-1
1877,jira,This is pretty embarassing ,-1
1878,jira,When you install a node module globally it goes into usr local where you don t have permissions to move shit into unless you sudo ,-1
1879,jira,That being said I m not totally opposed to making the limit configurable ,-1
1880,jira,My bad I screwed up the assertion RuntimeException transition ,-1
1881,jira,Well that sucks ,-1
1882,jira,No it s not off the table but it s moot unless we decide we want cqlsh in tree at all ,-1
1883,jira,Ok here is a patch that works I was stupid enough not to see it ,-1
1884,jira,It was a pretty stupid idea to use a static array of instances for QuorumOpMonitor ,-1
1885,jira,All I m trying to say is that it s pretty easy to end up in propagation failure hell here or change something else that blows things up for use cases that are not foreseen ,-1
1886,jira,Just to clarify you made the DTPE handle exceptions the same way as CassandraDaemon by updating it to use NBHS instead of CSLS Did you just tell me to go fuck myself ,-1
1887,jira, 1 damn intellij it s not like patch format hasn t been standard for years ,-1
1888,jira,Wow it s like Thrift is going out of their way to make life suck for us this month ,-1
1889,jira,Here is quite bad ,-1
1890,jira, The samples you gave are different ,-1
1891,jira,I just noticed your public tweet bq wilhelmbierbaum True Fuck the Avro C API ,-1
1892,jira,if so can you see if you can git bisect this bad boy ,-1
1893,jira,It seems some of the wrappers in ink hrtime h might no longer be used either e g ink gettimeofday is never used so lets get rid of that shit ,-1
1894,jira,Heh that s one hell of a bug 275 bytes exactly eh ,-1
1895,jira,What a stupid name I chose for that object ,-1
1896,jira,I think it s time to just close this issue ,-1
1897,jira,I m not entering bogus reports for the hell of it Matt,-1
1898,jira,I am currently trying to get it into AJDT dev builds but my git push is timing out damn thing ,-1
1899,jira,Stupid Maven,-1
1900,jira,Ok Stupid user Error here ,-1
1901,jira,Why the hell do they deliver Duration if they cannot instantiate it ,-1
1902,jira,The defect from hell 666 be scared ,-1
1903,jira,This really sucks ,-1
1904,jira,Why the hell is this not a bug ,-1
1905,jira,What the hell are you waiting for ,-1
1906,jira,I suspect it has nothing to do with the file system connector or Infinispan connectors and is simply a stupid mistake in the federated join processor ,-1
1907,jira,I m an idiot ,-1
1908,jira,It really sucks that there is now way currently to include transitive dependencies ,-1
1909,jira,I m an idiot there s nothing wrong with the readme txt ,-1
1910,jira,Crap forgot to verify that this is inconsistant with MRI it s not ,-1
1911,jira,Please close as this is just me being stupid ,-1
1912,jira,Holy hell I think I found one problem with turning a bignum into anything else ,-1
1913,jira,This sucks so much ,-1
1914,jira,Damn I would close this out from the fix to JBSEAM 3742 except the quartz and seampay examples use a custom XML namespace and the XML schema validator is not happy with that ,-1
1915,jira, Damn I forgot ,-1
1916,jira,Also your username was stupidly named and confusing so I deleted it and created a new one more appropriate ,-1
1917,jira,Damn it seemed it didn t work ,-1
1918,jira,It sucks to lose the code readability but it seems like a reasonable price to pay ,-1
1919,jira,I don t have to ensure that the classloader knows groovy classes you must do that ,-1
1920,jira,And debugging is hell because the test environment needs to have the exact same loader setup ,-1
1921,jira,who the hell starts using our jira for typing lessons ,-1
1922,jira,fuck u,-1
1923,jira,Hell this is gonna take me a lot of work to raise ,-1
1924,jira,That irritated the hell out of me too but I didn t realise it was configurable in the launch file ,-1
1925,jira,This sucks badly ,-1
1926,jira,Why on earth does createLink need a request ,-1
1927,jira,Finally closing this bug from hell ,-1
1928,jira,I sure as hell don t want to start attaching models for the sake of detaching them directly afterwards ,-1
1929,jira,That sucks why isn t the escape mechanism working ,-1
1930,jira,I am an idiot this was a dupe of GUVNOR 84,-1
1931,jira,Sun RI sucks why the hell is saveState and restoreState not called with with javax faces STATE SAVING METHOD server ,-1
1932,jira,Swear to god I m not a total idiot ,-1
1933,jira,I don t know how the hell my diff program decided to add seemingly random CR chars but I ve removed them now ,-1
1934,jira,durrrh that sucks ,-1
1935,jira,Im stuck with IE6 unfortunately ,-1
1936,jira,What the hell I ll give this a shot ,-1
1937,jira, quote searcher getAtomicReader getSortedDocValues uniqueKey quote This is a performance killer ,-1
1938,jira,As far as the query shit i have no idea if solrdispatchfilter or whatever could should do Thread currentThread setName x or whatever and maybe restore after ,-1
1939,jira,BTW This is one reason why I hate this autoboxing shit since Java 5 I would love to have a way to prevent it in code forbidden checks should detect this somehow ,-1
1940,jira,Hmm that sucks ,-1
1941,jira,tricky shit man I think I found the issue ,-1
1942,jira,Oh man it s a fucking precendence problem ,-1
1943,jira,Ugh well that sucks ,-1
1944,jira,I didn t know we needed to retain backwards config capability across 3 x to 4 x That sucks and it ll make old code stick around longer ,-1
1945,jira,bq this is solr s fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit ,-1
1946,jira,That sounds like some serious buck passing ,-1
1947,jira,This whole thing is very distressing to me ,-1
1948,jira,I think we all know it just sucks ,-1
1949,jira,though I disagree with a signficant amount of statements you made I don t think we would ever come to agreement anyway ,-1
1950,jira, that s some freaky shit ,-1
1951,jira,I think you made mistakes in ivy xml ,-1
1952,jira,This is where it gets confusing ,-1
1953,jira,If I can give you one advice on this one I d say this fuck Derby use H2 instead as the default embedded database ,-1
1954,jira,What the hell ,-1
1955,jira, Do nothing Are you serious about that ,-1
1956,jira, Oleg please accept that my logical is different from your logical ,-1
1957,jira,So I m fine with your logic but given that I don t understand it please don t get upset when I ask questions on how I have to use it ,-1
1958,jira,This was my bad ,-1
1959,jira,The rest are totally unrelated ,-1
1960,jira,Oh fuck Sorry Not my day more beer needed ,-1
1961,jira,Sorry I guess I m against never computing this shit because you guys think returning NaN is ok ,-1
1962,jira, if you want to make these optimizations fix the APIs so its intuitive otherwise no way ,-1
1963,jira,who the fuck is asking for scores but not the max score and why does their insanely specialized use case justify all these booleans on a central lucene class ,-1
1964,jira,I don t care about code duplication here ,-1
1965,jira, We should not invoke the global synced fieldnumbers shit for every element only when the setting actually changes,-1
1966,jira,I disagree and I guess I m willing to go to bat for this ,-1
1967,jira,HOLY SHIT ,-1
1968,jira, I think the comments here are a bad sign I sent us down an unfortunate slippery slope we are a search engine library don t put shit in the index directory or we will delete your shit dead simple ,-1
1969,jira,I wholeheartedly agree this API is confusing as hell ,-1
1970,jira,Not only it s the first one in my life I m seeing multiple ways of closing the same thing it also conceals programming errors ,-1
1971,jira,Sucks to rush a commit when an issue is under discussion ,-1
1972,jira,I m against such heavy committing myself without some consensus to do so ,-1
1973,jira,I m confused ,-1
1974,jira, I hated that aspect of working for commercial companies ,-1
1975,jira,My bad ,-1
1976,jira,My bad ,-1
1977,jira,Igor is an idiot and we do need gmake ,-1
1978,jira,Shit I missed a cast ,-1
1979,jira,But even if it wasn t it would be totally worthless where it is at ,-1
1980,jira,This is clearly bad webserver behaviour ,-1
1981,jira,Forget what I made D8067 ,-1
1982,jira,PreCommit HDFS Build is stuck ,-1
1983,jira,So it is stuck somewhere ,-1
1984,jira,I don t want one offs like this to become lost and forgotten ,-1
1985,jira,But now that I think about it it may crap out when coming back to read even on a recovered file ,-1
1986,jira, Matt I m an idiot I used the wrong patch Sigh ,-1
1987,jira,I m however very interested in this feature as it is essential to me ,-1
1988,jira,bq this is solr s fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit ,-1
1989,jira,Holy complicated as shit algorithm Batman The complexity of our implementation vs the complexity of what we re actually doing is starting to worry me here ,-1
1990,jira,It also happens at the very startup after he has loaded only 3 sstables hence DataTracker likely have 3 sstables not a shit load ,-1
1991,jira,Shit my bad The posted patch is from a completely wrong branch of my git repo I had not realized I ran the test patch against a branch not branch 1 ,-1
1992,jira, In this particular case Hoss clearly intended to use the no no word as an intensifier and not to stir shit ,-1
1993,jira,Maybe only one of us should play lawyer and the other one play engineer ,-1
1994,jira, I used to be the latter but then I went to law school and got a degree in this shit ,-1
1995,jira,Then to make matters worse since the mid 1990 s I ve been offering pro bono advice to non profit foundations whose members insult me regularly and assume I m an amateur ,-1
1996,jira,Someone but I m not sure who owes me a public apology here Larry ,-1
1997,jira,Shit there is an dependency Please go to Preferences LDAP Entry Editor and enable the option Show operational attributes ,-1
1998,jira,that s bad Content Type from gSOAP ,-1
1999,jira,Pull it back in if you think different ,-1
2000,jira,Hmm this is quite bad ,-1
2001,jira,You are messing down deep below hbase in dfs ,-1
2002,jira,Damn it sry lost the orientation ,-1
2003,jira,Oh my stupid ,-1
2004,jira,oh geez I m an idiot ,-1
2005,jira, jira I wish you didn t suck so much ,-1
2006,jira,Indeed that would be VERY bad design ,-1
2007,jira,My bad ,-1
2008,jira, How bad is this ,-1
2009,jira,I m confused ,-1
2010,jira,This is pretty trivial ,-1
2011,jira,Of course it could DOH ,-1
2012,jira,Then you re pretty well screwed ,-1
2013,jira,Damn Chuck is scary ,-1
2014,jira,This is bad ,-1
2015,jira,Well that sucks ,-1
2016,jira,Bad memory ,-1
2017,jira,The state stuck at Allocated state It is a dup of 3788 ,-1
2018,jira,This is a pretty awful bug ,-1
2019,jira,Replaced patch with fix to catch more bad variables,-1
2020,jira,Does this suck ,-1
2021,jira,Of course StrFieldSource is a private class No it s not ,-1
2022,jira,CSS is really confusing sometimes ,-1
2023,jira,Django is a fullstack framework Click is not ,-1
2024,jira,My bad ,-1

2463,jira,Hello Thanks a lot It works Lisa ,1
2464,jira,Yes please pull request away my friend ,1
2465,jira,If someone wants to take this over that s cool I m unlikely to have time in the next week and a half though ,-1
2466,jira,It is a nasty bug that I ve seen in real life though ,-1
2467,jira,Yes exactly sorry to be so unclear ,-1
2468,jira,I m not sure what the problem is but the behavior at least in 0 1 4 is that the isClosed AtomicBoolean is not being set to closed in a timely manner ,-1
2469,jira,Sorry for the delay and thanks for the good work works like a charm ,-1
2470,jira,Sorry I thought submit patch was the way to attach a patch ,-1
2471,jira,I don t have very much experience on branch 1 would you like to take a shot at the port ,-1
2472,jira,Especially I don t know very much about the test framework differences ,-1
2473,jira,I will figure out the details and do the port later this week if you don t get to it first ,-1
2474,jira,sorry unassigning myself from this backport ,-1
2475,jira,Another backport for a different jira of mine is failing and I want to see if I can figure out what might be wrong there before doing a new backport ,-1
2476,jira,To upgrade to a recent version of Jackrabbit see http wiki apache org jackrabbit BackupAndMigration I m afraid I can t say much about the risk ,-1
2477,jira,I ve tried something similar I removed the handlers and kept the readers but the performance was not visible ,-1
2478,jira,The responder seemed to be a bottleneck ,-1
2479,jira,But it was not the only issue we also want to manage priorities between the tasks but we need to read them to get enough information to make the right priorities ,-1
2480,jira,While creating the DerbyTest I did notice that this problem is caused by the Database pool because it tries to connect to the database in the background ,-1
2481,jira,Sorry fiberlijun havent had a chance to look at it yet ,-1
2482,jira, I could not get what KEYWORD means ,-1
2483,jira,I am checking out the dojo fixes and patching them in sorry for the delay it has been a long time ,-1
2484,jira, then we don t save IO by limiting the buffer size to 1 KB I m confused by this ,-1
2485,jira,Seems to be failing for a different reason now testContainerLaunch org apache hadoop yarn server nodemanager TestLinuxContainerExecutorWithMocks Time elapsed 0 523 sec FAILURE ,-1
2486,jira,Sorry for all the issue mails I forgot to mention the second 2 There is commented source in the test should it be enabled or removed ,-1
2487,jira,I m very sorry ,-1
2488,jira,Sorry guys I was the reason for this trouble ,-1
2489,jira,I should have been very careful before doing this ,-1
2490,jira,My bad forgot to include the test file in the patch Resubmitting in a second ,-1
2491,jira, sorry ,-1
2492,jira,Damn ,-1
2493,jira,Git is tricky that way ,-1
2494,jira,Sigh I don t like this overall if can t reuse everywhere ,-1
2495,jira,Sorry to let you lose a wild goose chase ,-1
2496,jira,You are going to kill me when I say this but it seems like we should just commit your first patch ,-1
2497,jira,This half reuse is more confusing for new devs who see this code for the first time ,-1
2498,jira,Sorry probably a misunderstanding from my side ,-1
2499,jira,I meet the same problem on Eclipse recently but haven t figured out how to get through ,-1
2500,jira,Sorry Chris I missed it done ,-1
2501,jira,One of the error is that hiddenActivations cannot be resolved ,-1
2502,jira,I m very busy for the moment so I didn t know when I d be able to the change myself so if you can your contribution would be one more time really appreciated ,-1
2503,jira,Oh I didn t consider one flow like after the edit log conversion immediately store failed ,-1
2504,jira,I misunderstood the case and sorry for the confusion ,-1
2505,jira,Aside from the job succeeding it doesn t what effect should I be able to measure in order to see if this is doing anything ,-1
2506,jira,You misunderstood the response StopFilter indeed did not change ,-1
2507,jira,You would need to implement session resume thats a whole new can of worms ,-1
2508,jira,Sorry for a mess in uploaded files my connection got broken during first upload ,-1
2509,jira,Here are 2 patches one for adjustExamplePaths bat sh and the other a new file holding 2 User Libraries UIMA LIB UIMA AS LIB Not sure where this should go ,-1
2510,jira,i found the class so there is no bug sorry,-1
2511,jira,I was not aware of being required to call that method ,-1
2512,jira,This is a silly one ,-1
2513,jira,Seems we didn t enforce an exec for sh but we did for fs ,-1
2514,jira,The patch should be relatively trivial but like I said I have no idea if there is other important stuff going on there or not ,-1
2515,jira,Igor sorry it took me so long to get back to this ,-1
2516,jira,Hey sorry I did not get back to you sooner ,-1
2517,jira,I found the sad attempt at a script you asked about and uploaded it to MAPREDUCE 4282 ,-1
2518,jira,Sorry for the delay ,-1
2519,jira,I don t have resources to hand to test this at mo ,-1
2520,jira,Yes it is a dup thanks Mike for taking care of this I planned to do this yesterday but didn t make it ,-1
2521,jira,Forgot to add that I also tried this with and without HBASE 5864,-1
2522,jira,but app developers should always explicitly set it based on their application My guess is that a large enough group of people take the defaults that it matters ,-1
2523,jira,App developers never do what they should ,-1
2524,jira,problem the bit to sign the source release is being called when the source release isn t being built because the source release is only built at the executionroot ,-1
2525,jira,Excuse me for stolen assignement ,-1
2526,jira,In current version the same error cause different messages because there are many commiters ,-1
2527,jira,Sorry for the missing class src java org apache jdo tck lifecycle StateTransitionsReturnedObjects java ,-1
2528,jira,Sorry if this was not clear and yes by blank I meant an empty string ,-1
2529,jira,Qianshi is working on the SSL session reuse but this buggy Bug system does not allow him assign this ticket sigh,-1
2530,jira,Hi Guillaume I did not have an answer right away so I sent you question to Leonard Rosenthol ,-1
2531,jira,Sorry should have commented on this much sooner ,-1
2532,jira,It is not yet tested I ran into strange build problems with APR ,-1
2533,jira,Done sorry for all the mess on a simple patch ,-1
2534,jira,Secondly reading this code I can see why this bug is happening after completing stage 2 above when adding the new item the code does ordered cancelled quantity which equates to 1 1 0 ,-1
2535,jira,Keep repeating this and the problem just gets worse ,-1
2536,jira,Please ignore attachment id 6938 ,-1
2537,jira,It was attached to the wrong bug ,-1
2538,jira, back from holidays so a bit delayed but I confirm Andrzej s suggestion a plain text only summarized is ideal for clustering for example ,-1
2539,jira,HTML is quite uncomfortable to work with ,-1
2540,jira,Hi Marco I changed the name of patch because it was made in Java earliar sorry for inconvenience ,-1
2541,jira,Sorry for the mistake ,-1
2542,jira,Not sure I want the transient inability to clean up some local log or other trivial task to kill a whole pig job ,-1
2543,jira,First guess something s getting confused about reversed ness ,-1
2544,jira,Sorry I took Martin s comment to mean the patch was committed and issue closed which certainly discarded all the patches the first time around ,-1
2545,jira,I don t know what just happened ,-1
2546,jira,The patch went to the wrong bug ,-1
2547,jira,Sorry again ,-1
2548,jira,Our caller may not notice what happend right now ,-1
2549,jira,Sorry for my poor review didn t notice try catch ,-1
2550,jira,It does not look very useful ,-1
2551,jira,Oh I m sorry I was unclear ,-1
2552,jira,Sorry Jacques I ll upload another file ,-1
2553,jira,I did it wrong this time ,-1
2554,jira,Sorry I had attached an older version let s try this one ,-1
2555,jira,However I figured it was better to get it in the public domain sooner and let the iterative process do it s work ,-1
2556,jira,This is only a problem with exceptions from java ,-1
2557,jira,Incidentally if we all nag Joe Walnes enough we might be able to persuade him to release a new qdox which can ignore annotations etc though it will still struggle with generics I think ,-1
2558,jira,Sorry I kind of forget about this one ,-1
2559,jira,I don t have strong opinions about it either way ,-1
2560,jira,Bugs like this make me sad ,-1
2561,jira,SnappyCodec check for Hadoop native lib is wrong ,-1
2562,jira,Sorry for the delay I m recreating the mirror now ,-1
2563,jira,Brandon sorry ,-1
2564,jira,I misread ,-1
2565,jira,Ignore comment ,-1
2566,jira,Seems to be a faulty mailserver setup at laguna industries com ,-1
2567,jira,Unfortunately in these days where everyone that can put a CD the right way up in a drive is a Linux Unix Windows Internet Expert this has become pretty common ,-1
2568,jira,And with a network that tolerates almost everything to get a mail somehow in the right place it is only seldom noticed or when it is it is blamed on Microsoft ,-1
2569,jira,Mac looks like the tests are failing especially TestHarFileSystem ,-1
2570,jira, Luke Sorry for the late attaching latest version patch,-1
2571,jira,RMAppAttemptImpl recoverAppAttemptTokens Looks like all changes in RMAppImpl are unnecessary ,-1
2572,jira,Bug in existing testDelegationTokenRestoredOnRMrestart ,-1
2573,jira,Sorry we are no longer using Xerces ,-1
2574,jira,That is a bit too lax I think ,-1
2575,jira,The cause is that the call to SpecificResponder writeError in Responder respond ultimately calls GenericData resolveUnion which in turn calls GenericData getSchemaName before the line where the UnresolvedUnionException gets thrown ,-1
2576,jira,I am new to Mina and the whole environment ,-1
2577,jira,I have this issue where my server and client is creating a lot of loopback threads that I believe must be related to this issue ,-1
2578,jira,Any word on whether it will be fixed ,-1
2579,jira,I did not have time to do it yesterday ,-1
2580,jira,Sorry for being confusing ,-1
2581,jira,I am not really sure what does the receive payment do before the shipment it doesn t sound as if it is doing what we expect it to do ,-1

2601,jira,Sorry about the confusion before,-1
2602,jira,Sorry ,-1
2603,jira,Sorry folks the full fix was committed in rather a messy manner due to some platform specific issues ,-1
2604,jira,Sorry didn t look at the code until commit Can you test making it hash to a Long or a 8 byte ByteBuffer ,-1
2605,jira,Sorry the above comes across as terse ,-1
2606,jira,I really don t know how to solve this problem ,-1
2607,jira,If you know of a way please describe it ,-1
2608,jira,Sorry ,-1

2616,jira,Sorry I ve been MIA on this issue ,-1

2634,jira,Some file were missing in the last patch sorry ,-1
2635,jira,The biggest problem is that we ve had too many committers over the years and we d have to get all of their permission to change it ,-1
